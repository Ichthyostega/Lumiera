# Excerpt of statistics utilities from Yoshimi-test

[Yoshimi](http://yoshimi.sourceforge.net/) is a software sound synthesizer, derived from ZynAddSubFx
and developed by an OpenSource community. The Repository [Yoshimi-test](https://github.com/Ichthyostega/yoshimi-test/)
is used by the Yoshimi developers to maintain a suite of automated acceptance tests for the Yoshimi application.

This task involves watching execution times to detect long-term performance trends,
which in turn requires to maintain time-series data and perfrom some simple statistic calculations.
Requiring any external statistics package as dependency was not deemed adequate for such a simple task,
and thus a set of very limited self-contained helper functions was created as a byproduct.

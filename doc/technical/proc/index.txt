Technical Documentation: Steam-Layer
====================================

Eventually, this section will hold technical documentation for the Steam-Layer.

Development Scrapbook TiddlyWiki
--------------------------------
Hermann VoÃŸeler, core developer of the Steam-Layer uses an separate embedded wiki
for his day-to-day design sketches, notes and also for the more persistent planning.
This *TiddlyWiki* is a nifty JavaScript wiki embedded in a single HTML page; as such
it lives right within the source tree, where it can be worked on alongside with the
code. Besides the actual planning and descriptions, this wiki also links to the
UML diagrams created with *BOUML* during the ongoing planning and design.

This setup started as a temporary solution -- but as uWiki is not expected to come
to life soon, the current website can't serve as replacement for a real wiki, an
we'll stick to that situation for the time being. As the content in the TiddlyWiki
becomes more mature and stable, it will be moved over into this section here.

While additions to the TiddlyWiki generally propagate to Lumiera/Master through
the normal merges, we've put up a rsynced version of the TiddlyWiki online for
direct access (of course read-only).

The Lumiera Debian Package
==========================

//Menu: label Debian Package

Since several of the Lumiera core developers run a Debian flavour as their primary development platform,
it seems natural to care for the debian packaging of Lumiera ourselves. Moreover, we've declared 
Debian/Stable to be our *reference platform* -- we'll provide any additionally required, more recent
packages through our own link:http://Lumiera.org/debian[Debian Apt-Repository] (Debian depot).

TIP: readers new to Debian packages may want to have a look into our
     link:{ldoc}/user/tutorials/DebianBuilding.html[Debian build tutorial],
     describing the commands for building and the structure of a Debian
     (source) package in general


Package build process
---------------------
As our whole infrastructure relies heavily on the Git version management tool, it's only natural
also to organise the (debian) packaging with the help of Git. Fortunately, there is a nifty tool
called link:https://honk.sigxcpu.org/piki/projects/git-buildpackage/[git-buildpackage], written
by Guido Günther exactly for this purpose: It treats the _debianisation_ as a branch in the
Git repository, forking off the mainline at the release point.

For Lumiera, this _debianisation branch_ is called 'deb' and can be found in the
link:http://git.lumiera.org/gitweb?p=debian/lumiera;a=summary[git:/git.lumiera.org/debian/lumiera] repository.

Installing Lumiera
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The link:SCons.html[SCons build] generates a relocatable distribution directory structure,
holding the main executable, additional tools and utilities, plus the core libraries and resources.
Here _relocatable_ means that this subtree can be moved and placed anywhere on the system.
As long as the relative directory layout remains intact, the executables will be able to find
and load the accompanying libraries and resources. By invoking the `scons install` target,
this directory structure is placed into the installation target directory.

Actually, this lookup process at application startup is performed in two phases

- in the first phase the main application locates the explicitly linked shared libraries.
  footnote:[generally speaking, we have to distinguish between dynamic libraries explicitly
  linked as part of the application, libraries linked as direct library dependencies, other
  transitive library dependencies, and finally shared objects, which are loaded at runtime
  through the `dlopen()` call.]
  Especially those libraries belonging first class to the Lumiera application are built
  with a relative search path ('rpath' with $ORIGIN token). These libraries are placed
  into the +modules/+ subfolder

- after successfully launching the executable, the second phase performs a lookup programmatically,
  starting from the path location of the executable. The goal is to find a +setup.ini+ which defines
  additional plug-ins and resources to load. Notably, the GUI to launch is loaded as a
  plug-in through this mechanism. Moreover, this *bootstrap configuration* defines the
  additional platform and user configuration to load for further outfitting of the system.

LSB Installation Layout
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This organisation is used as foundation for packaging and installing. The primary application
distribution structure will be located into a subfolder below +/usr/lib/+. Only the main application
executable will be symlinked into +/usr/bin/+. The LSB explicitly allows for such a layout, which is
typically used by large application bundles (OpenOffice, Gimp, Eclipse). Since the application
startup encompasses two phases, loading the extended configuration programmatically after
launching the application, extended resources from the application bundle can easily be
relocated into a separate folder below `/usr/share/`, as required by LSB.


Releases, Branches and Conventions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Official releases are marked by a tag on the master branch. At that point, master should be
in good shape, release documentation is polished; experimental features are removed or disabled.
Usually, we'll also fork a  *release branch* at that point, featuring bugfixes only.
From here we'll merge to the *debian branch*

Typically the release will lead to the discovery of more or less serious bugs, which are
fixed on the release branch and backported to master. The result is a sequence of point
releases. At the end of a stable release series, the release branch will be upgraded
with a single merge commit to the level of the next major release.


Package build commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To (re)build the debian package

. +git clone git:/git.lumiera.org/lumiera/debian+
. +mkdir pack.deb+
. +cd debian+
. +git-buildpackage --git-upstream-branch=+ _RELEASE-TAG_

-- here _RELEASE-TAG_ denotes the point in the Git history, which should become
the reference source and be packaged into the *.orig.tar.gz. Usually, it's just
sufficient to use 'master' for that purpose.


Debian-Depot for installation via Apt
-------------------------------------
In addition to the packaging, we maintain a dedicated Apt-Repository for automated
installation and upgrades. We try to build the package for several Debian derived
distributions (like Ubuntu). -> link:../infra/debianDepot.html[more on the repository organisation]

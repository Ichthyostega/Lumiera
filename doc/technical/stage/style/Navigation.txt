GUI style: Navigation
=====================

.UI Navigation and global styling conventions
This page explains some conventions and generic patterns used within the Lumiera UI,
especially with respect to navigation, toolbars and menus.

The Lumiera UI is deliberately prepared to live within multiple top-level windows,
which are typically placed into different desktop views or located on several monitors
at the editing desk. The views within these top-level windows are arranged each in accordance

presentation to an appropriate location, where it finds an existing view or creates a
new one to serve the need for presentation.

Scheduler and Job handling
==========================

The purpose of the _Scheduler_ is to run small self contained _Jobs_
ordered by priority and observing specific timing constraints.

About Jobs
----------
A job is a closure to run a small and limited action or operation, which
in itself _should not block_. Job may depend on each other and on resources
to be provided. A job may be rescheduled prior to invocation, but it is
activated at most once by an _Scheduler Action._

Lumiera Debian Package and Depot maintainance
=============================================

//Menu: label Debian Depot

This Debian-Depot is part of the Lumiera build infrastructure.
It is managed automatically, based on the link:http://mirrorer.alioth.debian.org/[reprepro] tool by Bernhard Link


The Lumiera debian package
--------------------------
As our whole infrastructure relies heavily on the Git version management tool, it's only natural
also to organise the (debian) packaging with the help of Git. Fortunatlely, there is a nifty tool
called link:https://honk.sigxcpu.org/piki/projects/git-buildpackage/[git-buildpackage], written
by Guido Günther exactly for this purpuse: It treats the _debianisation_ as a branch in the
Git repository, forking off the mainline at the release point.

For Lumiera, this _debianisation branch_ is called 'deb' and can be found in the
link:http://git.lumiera.org/gitweb?p=debian/lumiera;a=summary[git:/git.lumiera.org/debian/lumiera] repository.

To (re)build the debian package

. +git clone git:/git.lumiera.org/debian/lumiera+
. +mkdir pack.deb+
. +cd debian+
. +git-buildpackage --git-upstream-branch=+ _RELEASE-TAG_

-- here _RELEASE-TAG_ denotes the point in the Git history, which should become
the reference source and be packaged into the *.orig.tar.gz. Usually, it's just
sufficient to use 'master' for that purpose.


Debian-Depot for installation via Apt
-------------------------------------
While it is easy just to build a debian package and then install it locally through
+dpkg -i+, if we want to support automated installation and upgrades using the Apt
package manager, we need to build up more infrastructure. The primary reason is that
for any source package, a multitude of binary packages might be built for different
architectures; moreover, we want to support several different distributions.
For this purpose,the Apt package manager requires a precisely defined folder structure,
accessible online via 'http:' or 'ftp:'. For maintaining this folder structure, there
are three concievable levels of complexy:

minimal layout, manual maintainance::
  place everything in a single directory accessible online. Use only one pseudo-distribution
  and call the (single) component \'.\' -- just dump packages into the directory and update
  the packages list

multiple distributions and components, pool directory::
  this setup is already a full-blown debian depot, just there are some limitations
  on the flexibility: there might be only _one_ version of each package per distribution,
  and all different distributions use a shared pool (and thus require different packages
  to be labeled stringently)

major distribution or mirror site::
  similar to the above, this is a complete debian depot, but it is backed by a database
  and allows for much more flexible configuration and is highly automated.


For Lumiera, it seems the middle option is the right choice: while it still keeps the
infrastructure simple, it allows for multiple _distributions_ (Debian/stable, Ubuntu....)
and multiple _components_ (experimental, development, release). The mentioned 'reprepro'
tool provides this degree of functionality: Basically, this is a fixed directory structure
with some control files; the frontent is a commandline tool with a plethora of options
and quite some automation- and extension hooks. Internally, it uses an embedded BerkelyDB.

Using 'reprepro', existing source, binary or comined packages can be _added_ (imported)
into the structure with a single command; the files comprising the package are then
added automatically to the pool directory and all the indices, directories and GPG
signatures are created and updated automatically. Previous versions of the same
package are purged, when not needed by any existing package anymore

everyday usage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

import a package::
  +reprepro -V -C experimental include squeeze lumiera_0.pre.01-1+squeeze_i386.changes+
+
this adds the given binary lumiera package, together with all sources and the original
tarball to the 'squeeze' repository, into the 'experimental' section

dump out an entire repository::
  +reprepro -V export squeeze+
+
this will __re__generate all of the indices, signatures and metadata of the 'squeeze' repository


Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The current configuration and the state of the Debian Depot index files is tracked
is a separate branch in the 
link:http://git.lumiera.org/gitweb?p=debian/lumiera;a=shortlog;h=refs/heads/depot[debian/lumiera]
repository. (Note: this is a somewhat unconventional setup, insofar the 'depot' branch tracks
a directory tree completely separete from the main lumiera source tree tracked by the deb branch;
I choose this layout because of the marginal relevance of this depot management; I just didn't
want to create _yet another not so useful Git repository..._)

[NOTE]
.some special details to note in our setup
=======================================================================================================================
- each block in the 'distributions' file defines a repository for a ``distribution'' (e.g. Squeeze, Lucid, Maverick).
  Within such a repo, there are sections named 'Components'. 
- The _override_ files mentioned in the configuration allow to overwrite / replace arbitrary fields in the metadata of
  all packages added to that distribution.
- In this setup, we enabled the 'tracking' function: thereby reprepro will keep track of the dependencies between 
  binary packages, signatures, debianisation patches and original upstream tarballs. Never packages overwirte older
  ones -- _at any time there is at most one version of a package in the repository._ Parts not referred to anymore
  are automatically discareded. In our configuration, they are moved into the 'morguedir'
- Please make sure the *gpg signing key* is in proper order, because it protects against evil spirited manipulations.

current setup 3/2011
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
While later we want to automate most of this packaging business, currently it's done semi-manual.
Mostly, Ichthyo builds the packages on his local PC (or a VM) and then adds/imports them to the
'reprepro' -- changes are then propagated to lumiera.org via rsync; as kind of a backup, the
index files are also pushed to link:http://git.lumiera.org/gitweb?p=debian/lumiera;a=shortlog;h=refs/heads/depot[Git].

 I've made a little Picture about how I think the User Interface of a
 yet to be named Video Editor could be presented. There is no central
 notion of the camera/projector Model, which I think could be added
 anywhere in the Graphs as a Node with an unlimited Number of inputs.

 Automations are not yet part of the  Mockup, but could be added.
 Cross Bus connections would likely not be represented by Arrows in a
 real UI, but rather the Bus would be adressed by Name.

 The dotted Lines mean that one element expands to a different View,
 for example in a new Window.
 The same goes for the rectangles with the slashed outline, they
 represent another View, and the connection from the timeline to the
 compositing nodes will be by Name, and not by arrows. Default Names
 would be "Video Track #1", etc.

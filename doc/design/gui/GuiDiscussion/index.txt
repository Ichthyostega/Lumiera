=================================

In the early days of the Lumiera project, there was a lot of debate regarding
GUI concepts, -features and proposals.

GUI Brainstorming::
  We got a lot of proposed cool features. In order to channel this great influx of ideas,
  we set up a wiki page to allow basically open proposals. *Joel Holdsworth*, our GUI developer
  at that time, performed the herculean task to walk through this tremendous pile of entries,
  consolidate them and conduct a discussion. The link:GuiBrainstormingReviewed.html[GUI Brainstorming page]
  documents the discussion and some conclusions. Several proposals were sorted out -- it might be
  inspiring to look on the reasons why we

GUI Proposals::
  In addition, several people contributed complete or focussed concepts and design proposals

  *  link:Workspaces.html[about Workspace organisation]
  *  link:scrolling.html[about scrolling..]
  *  link:MenuAndShortcuts.html[Ideas for menus and shortcuts]

Timeline Discussion::
  In 2008, Joel reviewed all the available proposals and distilled a more coherent vision
  especially about the timeline, which certainly is at the heart of any video editor.

  _must read_ for anyone engaged into Lumiera GUI development.

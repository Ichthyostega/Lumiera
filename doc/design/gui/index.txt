Design Documents: GUI
=====================

In the early stages of the project, there was a lot of debate regarding
GUI concepts and -features and proposals.

link:GuiDiscussion/index.html[Here] is a collection of documents from these early
discussions.


.[red]#TODO# more contributions please... ;-)
We had several additional discussions and contributions on the mailinglist,
several people did even concept drawings. Collect these and add them here

NOTE: We use the term *Workflow* in our discussions to denote the more integral
      concerns of how to achieve given tasks within the application in the most
      suitable and stringent fashion. We tend to separate those more global
      considerations from the discussion of individual GUI features.

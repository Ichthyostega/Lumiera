Design Documents: Workflow
==========================

In our discussions, the term *Workflow* denotes specific considerations about _the way_
a given task can be achieved, within the application, in the most suitable and stringent fashion.
This effort is closely related to GUI and interface design, but likewise quite integral,
so we tend to treat it as a distinct effort, separate from the design of individual GUI features.

Interface Concept

This Concept Proposal approaches questions of interface design focussing on the Workflow.
Currently, the whole field of film production is in a state of transformation. Such a
time of change enables us to conceive new routes. Video editing technology today has
reached a level of maturity, powerful enough to shape it in accordance with our human
mode of expression, our needs and abilities when working with media. Things shouldn't
be done just because it's possible to do them -- to the contrary, we are entitled
to ask which route we want to go and we build our own tools accordingly.

Lumiera is developed as Free/OpenSource project under the GNU General Public License.
Source code is shared via Git, and ongoing development is publicly visible.
Discussions and contributions are welcome.

The vision and goals for the Lumiera application are far reaching and ambitious;
in the current phase the project has started to integrate concepts, structures
and subsystems developed over the course of several years, to create a coherent
architecture, able to support the vision.

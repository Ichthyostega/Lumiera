WARNING: under construction -- [red]#some parts to be filled in#


Terminology
-----------

Layer::
  A conceptual realm within the application to group related concerns and define an ordering.
  Layers are above/below each other and may depend _solely_ on lower layers. The Application
  may be operated in a partial layer configuration with only some lower layers. Each layer
  deals with distinct topics and has its own style. In Lumiera, we distinguish three layers
+
* User Interface -> Interaction
* Proc-Layer -> Processing
* Backend -> Data manipulation

Subsystem::
  A runtime entity which acts as anchor point and framework to maintain a well defined lifecycle.
  While layers are conceptual realms, subsystems can actually be started and stopped and their
  dependencies are represented as data structure. A subsystem typically starts one or several
  primary components, which might spawn a dedicated thread and instantiate further components
  and services.

Service::
  A component within some subsystem is termed _Service_
+
--
  * when it exposes an interfaces with an associated contract
    (informal rules about usage pattern and expectations)
  * when it accepts invocations from arbitrary other components
    without specific wiring or hard coded knowledge
--
+
The service lifecycle is tied to the lifecycle of the related subsystem; whenever the subsystem is ``up and running'',
any contained services can be accessed and used. Within Lumiera, there is no _service broker_ or any similar kind
of elaborate _service discovery_ -- rather, services are accessed *by name*, where ``name'' is the _type name_
of the service interface.

Dependency::
  A relation at implementation level and thus a local property of an individual component. A dependency
  is something we need in order to complete the task at hand, yet a dependency lies beyond that task and
  relates to concerns outside the scope and theme of this actual task. Which means, a dependency is not
  introduced by the task or part of the task, rather the task is the reason why some entity dealing with
  it needs to _pull_ the dependency, in order to be able to handle the task. So essentially, dependencies
  are accessed on-demand. Dependencies might be other components or services, and typically the user
  (consumer) of a dependency just relies on the corresponding interface and remains agnostic with respect
  to the dependency's actual implementation or lifecycle details.

Subsystems
----------
As a coherent part of the application, a subsystem can be started into running state. Several subsystems
can reside within a single layer, which leads to rather tight coupling. We do not define boundaries between
subsystems in a strict way (as we do with layers) -- rather some component is associated with a subsystem
when it relies on services of the subsystem to be ``just available''. However, the grouping into subsystems
is often also a thematic one, and related to a specific abstraction level. To give an example, the Player
deals with _calculation streams,_ while the engine handles individual _render jobs,_ which together form
a calculation stream. So there is a considerable grey area in between. Any code related with defining and
then dispatching frame jobs needs at least some knowledge about the presence of calculation streams; yet
it depends and relies on the scheduling service of the engine. In the end, it remains a question of
architecture to keep those dependency chains ordered in a way to form a one-way route: when we start
the engine, it must not instantiate a component which _requires the player_ in order to be operative.
Yet we can not start the player without having started the engine beforehand; if we do, its services
will throw exceptions due to missing dependencies on first use.

However, subsystems as such are not dynamically configured. This was a clear cut design decision (and the
result of a heated debate within the Lumiera team at that time). We do _not expect_ to load just some plug-in
dynamically, inserted via an UI-action at runtime, which then installs a new subsystem and hooks it into the
existing architecture. The flexibility lies in what we can do with the _contents_ of the session -- yet the
application itself is not conceived as set of Lego(TM) bricks. Rather, we identify a small number of coherent
parts of the application, each with its own theme, style, relations and contingencies.

Lifecycle
---------
Dependencies and abstraction through interfaces are ways to deal with complexity getting out of hand.
When done well, we can avoid adding _accidental complexity_ -- yet essential complexity as such can not
be removed, but with the help of abstractions it can be raised to another level.footnote:[Irony tags here.
There is a lot of hostility towards abstractions, because it is quite natural to conflate the abstraction
with the essential complexity it has to deal with. It seems compelling to kill the abstraction, in the
hope to kill the complexities as well -- an attitude rather effective, in practice...].
When components express their external needs in the form of dependency on an interface, the immediate tangling
at the code level is resolved, however, someone needs to implement that interface, and this other entity needs
to be _available_. It is now an architecture challenge to get those dependency chains ordered. A way to
circumvent this problem is to rely on a _lifecycle_ with several _phases._
This is the idea behind the subsystems and the subsystem runner.

. First we define an ordering between the subsystems. The most basic subsystem (the Engine) is started first.
. Within a subsystem, components may be mutually dependent. However, we establish a new rule, dictating that
  during the _startup phase_ only local operations within a single component are allowed. The component need
  to be written in a way that it does not need the help of anything ``remote'' in order to get its inner
  workings up and ready. The component may rely on its members and on other services it created, _owns and
  manages._ And sometimes we do need to rely on a more low-level service in another subsystem or in the
  application core.footnote:[A typical example would be the reliance on threading, locking or application
  configuration.] -- which then creates a hard dependency on _architecture level_
. Moreover, we ensure that all operational activity is generated by actual work tasks, and that such tasks
  in turn may be initiated _solely through official interfaces._ Such interfaces are to be _opened explicitly_
  at the end of the startup phase.
. In operational mode, any part of the system can now assume for its dependencies to be ``just available''.
. And finally we establish a further rule to _disallow extended clean-up._ Everything must be written in a
  way such that when a task is done, it is _really done_ and settled. (Obviously there are some fine points
  to consider here, like caching or elaborate buffer and I/O management). The rationale is that after leaving
  the operational phase at the end of `main()` the application is able to unwind in any arbitrary way.

The problem with emergencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This concept has a weak spot however: A catastrophic failure might cause any subsystem to break down immediately.
The handler within the subsystem's primary component will hopefully detect the corresponding exception and signal
emergency to the subsystem runner. However, the working services of that subsystem are already gone at that point.
And even while other subsystems get the (emergency) shutdown trigger, some working parts may be already failing
catastrophically due to their dependencies being dragged away suddenly.

Lumiera is not written for exceptional resilience or high availability. Our attitude towards such failures can
be summarised as ``Let it crash''. And this is another rationale for the ruling against extended clean-up.
Any valuable work done by the user should be accepted and recorded persistently right away. Actions on the
session are logged, like in a database. The user may still save snapshots, but basically any actual change
is immediately recorded persistently. And thus we may crash without remorse.

Static initialisation and shutdown
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A lot of fine points can be made about when precisely static objects in C\++ will be initialised or destroyed.
However, anything beyond the scope of `main()` is not meant to be used for regular application code. Extended
initialisation, dependency management and decommissioning -- when actually necessary -- should be part of the
application code proper.footnote:[this is established ``best practice'' for good reasons. The interplay of
static lifespan, various translation units and even dynamically loaded libraries together with shared access
becomes intricate and insidious quite easily. And since in theory any static function could use some static
variable residing in another translation unit, it is always possible to construct a situation where objects
are accessed after being destroyed. Typically such objects do not even look especially ``dead'', since the
static storage remains in place and still holds possibly sane values. Static (global) variables, like raw
pointers, allow to subvert the deterministic automatic memory management, which otherwise is one of the
greatest strengths of C++. Whenever we find ourselves developing extended collaborative logic based on
several statics, we should consider to transform this logic into regular objects, which are easier to
test and better to reason about. If it really can not be avoided to use such units of logic from a
static context, it should at least be packaged as a single object, plus we should ensure this logic
can only be accessed through a regular (non static) object as front-end. Packaged this way, the
most common and dangerous pitfalls with statics can be avoided.] And since Lumiera indeed allows
for link:{ldoc}/technical/library/Dependencies.html[[lazily initialised dependencies], we
establish the policy that *destructors must not rely on dependencies*. In fact, they should
not do any tangible work at all, beyond releasing other resources.

Lifecycle Events
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Application as a whole conducts a well defined lifecycle; whenever transitioning to the next phase,
a _Lifecycle Event_ is issued. Components may register a notification hook with the central _Lifecycle Manager_
(see 'include/lifecycle.h') to be invoked whenever a specific event is emitted. The process of registration
can be simplified by planting a static variable of type `lumiera::LifecycleHook`.

WARNING: A callback enrolled this way needs to be callable at the respective point in the lifecycle,
         otherwise the application will crash.

`ON_BASIC_INIT`::
  Invoked as early as possible, somewhere in the static initialisation phase prior to entering `main()`.
  In order to install a callback hook for this event, the client must plant a static variable somewhere.

`AppState`::
  This is the Lumiera ¬ªApplication Object¬´. It is a singleton, and should be used by `main()` solely.
  While not a lifecycle event in itself, it serves to bring up some very fundamental application services:
+
--
- the plug-in loader
- the application configuration
--
+
After starting those services within the `AppState::init()` function,
the event `ON_GLOBAL_INIT` is emitted.
 
`ON_GLOBAL_INIT`::
  When this event occurs, the start-up phase of the application has commenced. The command line was already
  parsed and the basic application configuration is loaded, but the subsystems are not yet initialised.

`Subsys::start()`::
  By evaluation of the command line, the application object determines what subsystems actually need to
  be started; those will receive the `start()` call, prompting them to enter their startup phase, to
  instantiate all service objects and open their business fa√ßade when ready

`ON_SESSION_START`::
  When this hook is activated, the session implementation facilities are available and the corresponding
  interfaces are already opened and accessible, but the session itself is completely pristine and empty.
  Basic setup of the session can be performed at that point. Afterwards, the session contents will be
  populated.

`ON_SESSION_INIT`::
  At this point, all specific session content and configuration has already be loaded. Any subsystems
  in need to build some indices or to establish additional wiring to keep track of the session's content
  should register here.

`ON_SESSION_READY`::
  Lifecycle hook to perform post loading tasks, which require an already completely usable and configured
  session to be in place. When activated, the session is completely restored according to the defaulted or
  persisted definition, and any access interfaces are already opened and enabled. Scripts and the GUI might
  even be accessing the session in parallel already. Subsystems intending to perform additional processing
  should register here, when requiring fully functional client side APIs. Examples would be statistics gathering,
  validation or auto-correction of the session's contents.

`ON_SESSION_CLOSE`::
  This event indicates to commence any activity relying on an opened and fully operative session.
  When invoked, the session is still in fully operative state, all interfaces are open and the render engine
  is available. However, after issuing this event, the session shutdown sequence will be initiated, by detaching
  the engine interfaces and signalling the scheduler to cease running render jobs.

`ON_SESSION_END`::
  This is the point to perform any state saving, deregistration or de-activation necessary before
  an existing session can be brought down. When invoked, the session is still fully valid and functional,
  but the GUI/external access has already been closed. Rendering tasks might be running beyond this point,
  since the low-level session data is maintained by reference count.

`Subsys::triggerShutdown()`::
  While not a clear cut lifecycle event, this call prompts any subsystem to close external interfaces
  and cease any activity. Especially the GUI will signal the UI toolkit set to end the event loop and
  then to destroy all windows and widgets.

`ON_GLOBAL_SHUTDOWN`::
  Issued when the control flow is about to leave `main()` regularly to proceed into the shutdown and
  unwinding phase. All subsystems have already signalled termination at that point. So this is the right
  point to perform any non-trivial clean-up, since, on a language level, all service objects (especially
  the singletons) are still alive, but all actual application activity has ceased.

`ON_EMERGENCY_EXIT`::
  As notification of emergency shutdown, this event is issued _instead of_ `ON_GLOBAL_SHUTDOWN`, whenever
  some subsystem collapsed irregularly with a top-level exception.

NOTE: all lifecycle hooks installed on those events are _blocking_. This is intentionally so, since any
      lifecycle event is a breaking point, after which some assumptions can or can not be made further on.
      However, care should be taken not to block unconditionally from within such a callback, since this
      would freeze the whole application. Moreover, implementers should be careful not to make too much
      assumptions regarding the actual thread of invocation; we only affirm that it will be _that specific_
      thread responsible for bringing the global lifecycle ahead at this point.

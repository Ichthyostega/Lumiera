This section will feature some rather high-level considerations regarding
the architecture of the application.

.Executive Summary
See link:ArchitectureSummary.html[here] for a short summary of the core architecture
ideas of the envisioned Lumiera Application.

.Rendering and Playback Control
This part of the architecture is concened with how to initiate, coordinate and control
the calculation processes necessary to generate visible / audible data from our source
media. This design is _not so much_ concerned with the actual calculations; indeed it
takes on an ``bird eye's view'', treating the actual render engine mostly just as an
opaque entity providing some service.

Lumiera Design: Application and Session Configuration
=====================================================

*TODO* : 'write design document'

The Lumiera application uses two quite different sources for configuration

- individual __settings values__ can be loaded from an application- and user configuration in the conventional way
- various facilities, especially in the Steam-Layer, base the actual behavour on __queries__, which are
  to be resolve employing a rules based system '(planned)'. Configuration rules will be provided by the
  application (defaults), a session template and rules stored in the actual session.

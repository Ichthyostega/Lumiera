Documentation
=============


This documentation section contains documentation for both users and developers.

== User ==

A user manual containing the full reference for using Lumiera is planned:

 * link:technical/index.html[Technical Documents]
 * link:technical/code/codingGuidelines.html[Style and Coding Guidelines]

=== the TiddlyWiki ===
Currently, Lumiera is still in the design- and evolution phase.
There is an embedded JavaScript wiki (TiddlyWiki) within the source tree, mostly
used as design notebook, featuring day-to-day design sketches, notes but also
quite some more persistent planning. Finished documentation text is constantly
moved over to the documentation section(s) of the Lumiera website.

-> access the Development link:{l}/wiki/renderengine.html[TiddlyWiki online here]

=== API Documentation ===
We use the link:http://doxygen.org[Doxygen] tool to extract
code comments and generate code level API and reference documentation.

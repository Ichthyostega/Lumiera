-------------------------------------

The situation focussed by this concept is when an API needs to expose a sequence of results, values or objects,
instead of just yielding a function result value. As the naive solution of passing an pointer or array creates
coupling to internals, it was superseded by the GoF http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterator[Iterator pattern].
Iteration can be implemented by convention, polymorphically or by generic programming; we use the latter approach.


Lumiera Forward Iterator concept
--------------------------------
.Definition
An Iterator is a self-contained token value, representing the promise to pull a sequence of data

 - rather then deriving from an specific interface, anything behaving appropriately _is a Lumiera Forward Iterator._ 
 - the client finds a typedef at a suitable, nearby location. Objects of this type can be created, copied and compared.
 - any Lumiera forward iterator can be in _exhausted_ (invalid) state, which can be checked by +bool+ conversion.
 - especially, default constructed iterators are fixed to that state. Non-exhausted iterators may only be obtained by API call.
 - the exhausted state is final and can't be reset, meaning that any iterator is a disposable one-way-off object.
 - when an iterator is _not_ in the exhausted state, it may be _dereferenced_ (+*i+), yielding the ``current'' value
 - moreover, iterators may be incremented (+++i+) until exhaustion.


Discussion
~~~~~~~~~~
The Lumiera Forward Iterator concept is a blend of the STL iterators and iterator concepts found in Java, C#, Python and Ruby.
The chosen syntax should look familiar to C++ programmers and indeed is compatible to STL containers and ranges.
To the contrary, while a STL iterator can be thought off as being just a disguised pointer, the semantics of Lumiera Forward Iterators is deliberately reduced to a single, one-way-off forward iteration, they can't be reset, manipulated by any arithmetic, and the result of assigning to an dereferenced iterator is unspecified, as is the meaning of post-increment and stored copies in general. You _should not think of an iterator as denoting a position_ -- just a one-way off promise to yield data.

Another notable difference to the STL iterators is the default ctor and the +bool+ conversion.
The latter allows using iterators painlessly within +for+ and +while+ loops; a default constructed iterator is equivalent
to the STL container's +end()+ value -- indeed any _container-like_ object exposing Lumiera Forward Iteration is encouraged
to provide such an +end()+-function, additionally enabling iteration by +std::for_each+ (or Lumiera's even more convenient
 +util::for_each()+).
 
Implementation notes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
*iter-adapter.hpp* provides some helper templates for building Lumiera Forward Iterators.

 - _IterAdapter_ is the most flexible variant, intended for use by custom facilities.
   An IterAdapter maintains an internal back-link to a facilitiy exposing an iteration control API,
   which is accessed through free functions as extension point. This iteration control API is similar to C#,
   allowing to advance to the next result and to check the current iteration state.
 - _RangeIter_ wraps two existing iterators -- usually obtained from +begin()+ and +end()+ of an STL container
   embedded within the implementation. This allows for iterator chaining.
 - _PtrDerefIter_ works similar, but can be used on an STL container holding _pointers,_
   to be dereferenced automatically on access

Similar to the STL habits, Lumiera Forward Iterators should expose typedefs for +pointer+, +reference+ and +value_type+. 
Additionally, they may be used for resource management purposes by ``hiding'' a ref-counting facility, e.g. allowing to keep a snapshot or restult set around until it can't be accessed anymore.


Tasks
^^^^^
The concept was implemented both for unit test and to be used on the _QueryResolver_ facility; thus it can be expected
to show up on the session interface, as the _PlacementIndex_ implements _QueryResolver_. QueryFocus also relies on that
interface for discovering session contents. Besides that, we need more implementation experience.

Some existing iterators or collection-style interfaces should be retro-fitted. See http://issues.lumiera.org/ticket/349[Ticket #349]. +
Moreover, we need to gain experience about mapping this concept down into a flat C-style API.



Alternatives
^^^^^^^^^^^^
. expose pointers or arrays
. inherit from an _Iterator_ ABC
. unfold the iteration control functions into the custom types
. define a selection of common container types to be allowed on APIs
. use _active iteration,_ i.e. pass a closure or callback


Rationale
~~~~~~~~~
APIs should be written such as not tie them to the current implementation. Exposing iterators is known to create
a strong incentive in this direction and thus furthers the creation of clean APIs.

Especially in Proc-Layer we utilise already several iterator implementations, but without an uniform concept, these remain
just slightly disguised implementation types of a specific container. Moreover, the STL defines various and very elaborate
iterator concepts. Ichthyo considers most of these an overkill and an outdated aproach. Many modern programming languages build
with success on a very simple iterator concept, which allows once to pull a sequence of values -- and nothing more.

Thus the idea is to formulate a concept in compliance with STL's forward iterator -- but augmented by an stop-iteration test.
This would give us basic STL integration and look familiar to C++ and Java programmers without compromising the clean APIs.

Design Process : Coding Style
=============================

[grid="all"]
`------------`-----------------------
*State*         _Final_
*Date*          _2007-06-27_
*Proposed by*   link:ct[]
-------------------------------------




CodingStyle
-----------
Define coding style standard which we will use.




Description
~~~~~~~~~~~
We need to agree on some coding style, IMHO consistency is the most important
part with this, no matter which style we use.

See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indent_style[]

.Notes:
* no tabs, use spaces!

.Proposed:
* K&R by _ichthyo_
* compact and well known
* GNU by _cehteh_
* imo the best readability (albeit little strange)
* Lumiera might apply as official GNU project someday


Another question: __how to write identifiers?__

.Proposed:
* ichthyo: use CamelCase, start ClassNames upper case and variableNames
  in lower case. Make all namespaces and package (dir) names completely lowercase




Tasks
^^^^^
* Bouml config to generate this style
* footers (or headers) to configure common editors to use this style by default





Conclusion
----------
we agreed on GNU style

Comments

Since link:ct[] called spaces instead of tabs first, we should stick to that. I
think all other reasons will lead us to nowhere!

Although I'm used to a BSD/KNF-like coding style I will try the GNU one. After
all, the wikipedia page mentions no disadvantages of that style :)

I just proposed K&R because it is widely accepted. Personally, I was never very
fond of K&R style, I always preferred putting opening braces to the left. I
never used GNU style until now, but it looks somewhat appealing to me. (btw,
ECLIPSE comes with presets for all this styles :-P ). Anyhow, I can adapt to
most any style. The only thing I really dislike is using tabs (with the
exception of database DDLs and CSound files, where tab are actually helpful) :)

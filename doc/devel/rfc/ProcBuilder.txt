Builder within the Proc-Layer
-----------------------------
One of the core ideas of the Proc-Layer (as being implemented since summer '07 by Ichthyo) is the use of the Builder-pattern to achieve a separation between high-level view and low-level view.

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~
The Proc-Layer differentiates into a high-level view, which models the properties of the problem domain (manipulating media objects), and a low-level model, which is a network of render nodes and will be optimized for processing efficiency. 

In between sits the Builder, which is triggered on all important/relevant changes to the high-level model. 

The Builder inspects the current state of this high-level model and, driven by the actual objects and their configuration, creates a corresponding representation within the low-level model, which is then hot-swapped into the renderer. 

In the course of this building process, all necessary decisions are taken, disabled features and impossible connections are detected and left out, and all more elaborate or macro-like structures (e.g. meta clips) are broken down into simple building blocks, which can be implemented 1:1 by render nodes in the low-level model.

The configuration of the high-level model is deliberately very open; the builder doesn't impose much limitations, rather he reflects the found configuration down into the low-level model using generic rules. 

Pros
^^^^
 * Separation, decoupling
 * Architectural approach instead of just hacking away...

Cons
^^^^
 * Increases the overall complexity
 * More work to be done to get a minimal system implemented

Rationale
~~~~~~~~~
This design was chosen as a direct consequence of the problems encountered in the Cinelerra-2 codebase.

 * Separating this way allows us to take on different viewpoints on what is "good" and "efficient".
 * In the low-level view simplicity and efficiency of computation is the main criterion.
 * Whereas in the high-level view a good modeling of the problem domain and maximum flexibility is preferable.
 * The high-level view is taken out of the critical code path, allowing for advanced and even experimental technologies without endangering the whole application's usability. In the low-level realm, 'speed' is measured in ms, whereas in the high-level domain, speed is rather measured in 100ms.
 * The separation creates distinct interfaces and allows people with very different skill sets to work in parallel at the various levels of the App.


Conclusion
----------
This proposal reflects a distinct approach taken right from start.

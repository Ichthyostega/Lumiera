Past Meetings
=============

//Menu: sort children descending

Not all meetings gets summarized on this page. For example, there are no meeting
summaries at all available for 2010. This only means that there were not enough
things that needed deciding/documenting during these meetings to warrant someone
spending time on the task of writing a summary.

Anyone interested in Lumiera development is also encouraged to read mailing list
archives and other documentation.

.informal meetings, no summaries
********
In 2010, the monthly meetings where rather informal gatherings,
without any relevant decisions beyond the organisation of conference activities.
During that time, usually the two remaining Lumiera core developers where alternatively
either prevented by real-life obligations, or otherwise just in ``deep coding mode''

Two main points of discussion:
    - Scheduler tests to examine its suitability
    - Using Gstreamer to view video for our verttical slice


Test Scheduler Suitability
--------------------------

Once the scheduler had been implemented it was necessary to subject it
to various load tests to establish its stability, and stress tests were necessary to
provide information on performance limitations so that we would be able to establish
whether these limitations met the demands required by Lumiera. 
Results were encouraging.

_Ichthyo_ reported on stress tests on the new scheduler. With over 500 test
jobs the scheduler was stable. Stress tests revealed typical limitations of
the scheduler, which exhibited behaviour that is well within the requirements
oof Lumiera. Load tests showed that the sheduler remained stable when
subjected to heavy loads.

Stress tests wrere somewhat more involved as it was necessary
to establish reasonable performance boundaries of the scheduler: we can always
overload any scheduler with 
fanatically huge numbers of jobs so that beyond its abaility to process all jobs on the
queue. Indeed scheduler performace is always a delicate and complex area to
investigate. Of interest, however, is to establish some reasonable information
on the processing rate of the schedular which
_Ichthyo_ was able to estimate statistically by carefully observing the
scheduler under a collection of various loads.

Some goals of the tests:

 - tests to establish the scheduler breaking point or performance limitations
 - tests under pressure with high loads and high parallelism
 - test to demonstrate that the scheduler is stable under load for several seconds 

Tests on various hardware constellations are not expected to reveal any
unexpected information.

Tests will not ultimately resolve the issue of whether the scheduler can perform
as desired, but by carefully selecting the kind of tests to subject the
scheduler to can reduce the probility of unexpected performance bottleneck.   


GStreamer Demo to Play Video
----------------------------

_Benn_ has written a simple GStreamer demo so that a video in raw format can be
displayed on the GUI for the current vertical slice. Should the output be directly
played in some widget, or is it better to load the pixels into some
buffer in memory which can then be displayed by some other mechanism.

This is a general question requiring further investigation: play a video
directly or supply the raw data directly in some buffer?

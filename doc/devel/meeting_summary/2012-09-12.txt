_Summary written by cehteh_



RFCs
----

It was not clear what state
link:{ldoc}/devel/rfc.html[RFCs] have in our
documentation structure. The question was if they should, after
becoming finalized integrated into some other document or stay first
class and be referenced from other documents.

_Ichthyo_ points out that RFCs and doxygen comments alone aren't
sufficient and that there is the need for summarizing technical
documentation pages. There is agreement that we want to avoid multiple
redundant point for one and the same thing. When things evolve and are
implemented they are documented elsewhere, thus multiple places for
the same thing but at different states come up.

Conclusion
~~~~~~~~~~
So we define the following procedure:

 * RFC's are first class citizens, _cehteh_ already made some relevant
   changes to the RFC system to provide static paths (the states are
   now symlinks to a pool)
 * If some more detailed design or implementation documentation arises
   then it should link back to the relevant RFC's
 * We add links to the RFC's themselves to link to any further
   Documentation describing details thereof
 * _cehteh_ will write an RFC about this Documentation workflow itself



Upgrade to Wheezy/GTK-3
-----------------------

*Debian 7* (wheezy) is in the freeze, we considered in the previous
meeting to bump our _reference platform_ to wheezy and by that switch
over to GTK-3.

_mfisher31_ did some work, fixing some bugs gcc4.7 pointed out and
compile Lumiera with GTK-3. There are some issues remaining:

. There is some library loading glitch, after building Lumiera won't
  start but on the next boot it works fine.
. It is not clear what effort is actually necessary to switch to GTK-3
. Theming is completely different in GTK-3, only using cairo rendering,
  Lumiera with GTK-3 has only the default theme right now.
. The video player widget is broken
. There is no libgdlmm3 debian package in wheezy.

Nevertheless we agree on the following...

Roadmap
~~~~~~~

- The devel server will be upgraded to wheezy
- Builddrone v2 will be deployed there (see below)
- The master branch will stay with GTK-2 and made compilable on wheezy
  (apply the gcc4.7 fixes) and then be frozen.
- We will provide a custom gdlmm3 package as we did before
- Work progresses on GTK-3 and we merge that back to the master
  branch when it is in par with what the GTK-2 looks alike already (no
  regressions)



Workflow between the Master and the Documentation repository
------------------------------------------------------------

There was some confusion how the master and the documentation
repository relate to each other.

We agreed on merging back and forth between in a bidirectional way,
but doing this lazy on demand.

(_cehteh_ will document this in a RFC)



Builddrone v2
-------------

A complete rewrite of Builddrone (a continuous integration system) is
now (almost) finished and will be deployed on our build server within
the next days. It has numerous improvements over the old one. More
information and documentation will appear at
https://builddrone.pipapo.org/ soon. Stay tuned.

Thanks to Lenny for helping with the documentation and Simon for the
Logo.



Trac
----

Trac is broken somehow, resetting passwords doesn't work anymore,
don't loose your cookies or you are lost. Manually resetting the
password by an admin works though. We could not figure out whats
wrong, will see next time what to do and fix it.



Git Commit Message Format
-------------------------

To ease automatic processing (builddrone, quaterly news,
changelogs,..) we agreed and finalized a
link:{rfc}/GitCommitMessageFormat.html[RFC GitCommitMessageFormat]
defining some formalism about commit messages.

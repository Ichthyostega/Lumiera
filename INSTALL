Newbies Tutorials

This page contains some tutorials for beginners that want to help to the
developers of Lumiera.

Trying the Lumiera GUI from Joel

You need to have:

  * libboost
  * libtool
  * git
  * libgavl
  * nobug(see below)

For Ubuntu Hardy also:

  * libglade2-dev
  * libgdl-1-dev
  * libgtkmm-2.4-dev
  * libxv-dev

also check http://gnuradio.org/trac/wiki/UbuntuInstall#InstallationOptions to
see that all your installations options are met.

Installing nobug from git

Create a temp directory where you can have the sourcecode of the libraries you
will use as well as lumieras branches you want to try. Example ~/temp. cd to
that directory and run:

git clone git://git.pipapo.org/nobug

This will create a directory called nobug with sourcecode in your current
directory.

cd nobug
autoreconf -i
mkdir build
cd build
../configure
make
make install

Getting the Lumiera source code

In the temp directory

git clone git://git.lumiera.org/LUMIERA
cd LUMIERA
autoreconf -fi
mkdir build
cd build
../configure
make

maybe run the testsuite by

make check

This will take some time. After it has finished:

./lumiera

Contributing

Nothing is easier, follow the basic instructions at http://www.kernel.org/pub/
software/scm/git/docs/gittutorial.html, notably the

$ git config --global user.name "Your Name Comes Here"
$ git config --global user.email you@yourdomain.example.com

parts.

Then you are ready to go, you can edit and commit the lumiera code locally in
your cloned repository. Please do small commits which fix/improve only one
single thing and use meaningful commit messages. Check that you didn't broke
anything

  * by running 'make check'.

Finally you can push your changes to the lumiera server to the 'mob'
repository:

$ git push git://git.lumiera.org/lumiera/mob master:refs/heads/YOURNAME

This creates a new branch 'YOURNAME' on the mob repository. Then you notify the
other devs on the mailinglist and they may merge your code into the mainline.

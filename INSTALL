This page contains some tutorials for beginners interested in Lumiera development.


Building Lumiera from source
----------------------------
Currently, after building the application, you can try out the Lumiera GUI
and you can run the testsuite.

For building Lumiera, besides the GNU C/C++ compiler (Version 4.X), you'll need:

 * http://git-scm.com/[git]
 * http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/[libtool]
 * http://www.boost.org/[Boost libraries]
 * http://gmerlin.sourceforge.net/[GAVL library]
 * *NoBug* (see below)

TIP: Generally speaking, when you want to build software, you need the _development_ version
of the packages, containing the headers and pre-built libraries to link against. Usually,
these packages are named `-devel` or `-dev`

.Notes for Ubuntu:

On Hardy you need also:

 * libglade2-dev
 * libgtkmm-2.4-dev
 * libxv-dev

For most Debian based systems, e.g. Ubuntu Intrepid and Jaunty, you can install these dependencies with:

------------------------------------------------------------
sudo apt-get install build-essential autoconf libboost-dev libboost-program-options-dev libboost-regex-dev \
             libtool libgavl-dev libglade2-dev libgdl-1-dev libgtkmm-2.4-dev libxv-dev scons valgrind librsvg2-dev git-core
------------------------------------------------------------


Build directory
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You need a directory for checking out the sources and running the build. This could be a temp directory,
or some "workspace" directory below your home directory. We'll call it _workspace directory_ from now on.

Lumiera specific libraries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Now that you have your basic build system setup, Lumiera needs a few more special support libraries.
Currently you need to build those from source and install them, so the Lumiera build process can
pick them up.

WARNING: Note that the following procedures will try to install files into your base system below `/usr/local`.
To do so, you'll need administrative permissions for the machine you're working on. These additions might interfere
with other libraries installed by your package manager (if you get into trouble updating your system later on,
sometimes you need to remove these manually built librararies). 

Installing NoBug
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*NoBug* is an instrumentation and diagnostics library. +
Go into the mentioned _workspace direcory_ (maybe create a new directory). First, let's get the NoBug source code:

------------------------------------------------------------
git clone git://git.pipapo.org/nobug
------------------------------------------------------------
This will create a (sub)directory called nobug with sourcecode in your current directory. +
Compile NoBug with the following commands

------------------------------------------------------------
cd nobug
autoreconf -i
mkdir build
cd build
../configure
make
make install
------------------------------------------------------------

Installing GDL
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The *GNOME Docking library* is generally available through your package manager, but
we contributed some improvements, which are only available in the very recent development
versions of GDL. Thus, for now we created a special package, which doesn't interfere with
an existing (older) installation of GDL.

Ubuntu 9.04 note: intltool-update is not patched, you must add /usr/share/intltool-debian/ to get the gdl-package to configure correctly (JSC).

------------------------------------------------------------
git clone git://git.lumiera.org/gdl-package
cd gdl-package
./configure
make
sudo make install
------------------------------------------------------------

For more detailed instructions on how to build gdl (also how to build it into a debian package) see
http://lists.lumiera.org/pipermail/lumiera/2009-April/000891.html[this message on the Lumiera Mailinglist].


check library linkage
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The compile will warn you to add various directories to /etc/ld.so.conf and then run ldconfig. This
will allow your dynamic liker to pick up the newly built libraries later when you try to start Lumiera.
If you don't want to reconfigure your system and add `/usr/local/lib` to the mentioned linker configuration,
you may alternatively just add the directories to your LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable.

Either way, check that all libraries are accessible and ok:

------------------------------------------------------------
sudo ldconfig -v | grep 'gdl-lum\|nobug'
------------------------------------------------------------

and you should get a list of the libraries, part of which should look like this:

------------------------------------------------------------
        libnobug.so.0 -> /usr/local/lib/libnobug.so.0.0.0
        libnobugmt.so.0 -> /usr/local/lib/libnobugmt.so.0.0.0
        libgdl-lum.so.0 -> /usr/local/lib/libgdl-lum.so.0.0.0
------------------------------------------------------------

or similar. If any if this libs are not listed, investigate why before continuing. 


Building Lumiera
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Lumiera has two maintained (and equivalent) build systems: *scons* and *autotools*. You can pick the one you
feel more comfortable with.

When trying to build a development version of Lumiera, it might well be that at times one of the builds doesn't work temporarily. It is always a good idea to check the current build stats from our *builddrone*, which automatically builds the latest version from master repository. +
Please have a look at this http://lumiera.org/builddrone/table.html[current build stats]-page.

Next, after having built and installed the prerequisite libraries, go into the _workspace directory_ to retrieve the Lumiera source code and build it.


 * to retrieve the sourcecode with git and then build with *scons*:
+ 
(see available build options by issuing `scons -h` )
+
-----------------
git clone git://git.lumiera.org/LUMIERA
cd LUMIERA
scons
-----------------
+
   
 * alternatively, if you prefer building with *autotools*:
+
-----------------
git clone git://git.lumiera.org/LUMIERA
cd LUMIERA
autoreconf -fi
mkdir build
cd build
../configure
make
-----------------

maybe build and run the testsuite by issuing `scons check` or `make check`

This will take some time.

NOTE: you can't _install_ Lumiera currently. Don't try it, it won't work.
Just run it from the build directory.

After the build has finished successfully, you should be able to start Lumiera.
Currently, this will bring up the GUI, without any further functionality

 * for autotools build: issue `./lumiera` (from within the `build` subdirectory)
 * for scons build:
+
-------------------
cd bin
./lumiera
-------------------

you should see something like (screenshot from 1/2009):

Contributing
------------

Nothing is easier, follow the http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/gittutorial.html[the basic instructions],
notably the following parts:
------------------------------------------------------------
$ git config --global user.name "Your Name Comes Here"
$ git config --global user.email you@yourdomain.example.com
------------------------------------------------------------


Then you are ready to go, you can edit and commit the lumiera code locally in your cloned repository. Please do small commits which fix/improve only one single thing and use meaningful commit messages. 

Check that you didn't break anything, by running the testsuite (see above)

Finally you can push your changes to the lumiera server to the 'mob' repository:

------------------------------------------------------------
$ git push git://git.lumiera.org/lumiera/mob master:refs/heads/YOURNAME 
------------------------------------------------------------
This creates a new branch 'YOURNAME' on the mob repository. Then you notify the other devs on the mailinglist and they may merge your code into the mainline.

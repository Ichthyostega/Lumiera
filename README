Lumiera -- the video NLE for Linux
====================================
Version: 0.pre.02
:Date: 4/2014

*************************************************************
Lumiera is a non-linear video editing and compositing tool.

The Application will allow to edit footage in the common
multimedia formats (quicktime, ogg, mkv, avi) and audio/video
stream codecs (dv, mpeg1/2/4, h264 ...)

Lumiera features non-destructive editing, compositing tools,
a selection of effects plugins, processing in RGB, YUV and
RGB-float colour models and the ability to mix media with
differing sizes and framerates. Lumiera is especially well
suited for large and elaborate professional editing tasks
with lots of material, several scenes, nested sequences,
colour grading, 3D support, full fledged sound montage
and multiple edit versions prepared in parallel.

NOTE: as of 10/2013, Lumiera is in early development stage;
it is not usable yet. The above describes the Lumiera project
vision, which will need years to implement. This Debian package
installs a current development snapshot in pre-alpha stage.

Lumiera pre-Alpha Versions
--------------------------

**This source tree doesn't yet contain a working video editing application** +
Rather, it contains the framework and technology core
of the envisioned Application ``Lumiera''.

See http://issues.lumiera.org/roadmap[Project roadmap]

As of _10/2013_ (0.pre.02)::
the data models have been elaborated and some significant parts of the session
are finished. Work has continued with time handling, a draft of the output
connection framework, a draft of the player subsystem and interfaces to the
engine and processing network. Unfortunately there was a considerable slowdown
and decrease in team size, yet still the code base is growing towards 90k LOC.
No tangible progress regarding the GUI and the backend.

As of _1/2011_ (0.pre.01)::
the project has created and documented a fairly consistent design,
partially coded up -- starting from the technical foundations and working up.
The code base is approaching 65k LOC. Roughly half of this is test code.
The Application can be installed and started to bring up a GTK GUI framework,
but the GUI is very preliminary and not connected to core functionality.
The video processing pipeline exists only in the blueprints.

As of _2/2008_::
the project has been separated completely from ``Cinelerra'', the parent project.
The Community, which at that time was largely identical to the Cinelerra-CV community,
choose the new project name ``Lumiera'' through a collaborative selection and vote.
The basic project infrastructure is up and running, and work on the new codebase
has started. We can show nothing beyond a test suite for some time to come.

As of _7/2007_::
we started with the backend and render engine draft, some example code
complemented by several unit tests. There is a TiddlyWiki with detailed
design considerations and developer documentation and a UML model

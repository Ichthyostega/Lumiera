   *         construction pattern
   *       - helper to [chain iterators](\ref verifyChainedIterators)

   *       - a [recursively self-integrating](\ref verifyRecrusiveSelfIntegration)
   *         evaluation pattern
   * 
   * \par Explanation
   * Both this test and the IterExplorer template might be bewildering
   * and cryptic, unless you know the Monad design pattern. Monads are
   * heavily used in functional programming, actually they originate
   * from Category Theory. Basically, Monad is a pattern where we
   * combine several computation steps in a specific way; but instead
   * of intermingling the individual computation steps and their
   * combination, the goal is to separate and isolate the mechanics
   * of combination, so we can focus on the actual computation steps:
   * The mechanics of combination are embedded into the Monad type,
   * which acts as a kind of container, holding some entities
   * to be processed. The actual processing steps are then
   * fed to the monad as "function object" parameters.
   * 
   * Using the monad pattern is well suited when both the mechanics of
   * combination and the individual computation steps tend to be complex.
   * In such a situation, it is beneficial to develop and test both
   * in isolation. The IterExplorer template applies this pattern
   * to the task of processing a source sequence. Typically we use
   * this in situations where we can't afford building elaborate
   * data structures in (global) memory, but rather strive at
   * doing everything on-the-fly. A typical example is the
   * processing of a variably sized data set without
   * using heap memory for intermediary results.

       * \par Test data structure
       * We build a functional datastructure here, on the fly, while exploring it.
       * The \c exploreChildren(m) function generates this tree like datastructure:
       * For a given number, it tries to divide by 5, 3 and 2 respectively, possibly
       * generating multiple decimation sequences.
       * 
       * If we start such a tree structure e.g. with a root node 30, this scheme yields:
       * \code
       * (       30       )
       * (   6   10   15  )
       * ( 2 3  2  5  3 5 )
       * ( 1 1  1  1  1 1 )
       * \endcode
       * This tree has no meaning in itself, beyond being an easy testbed for tree exploration schemes.
       * 
       * \par How the exploration works
       * We use a pre defined Template \link DepthFirstExplorer \endlink, which is built on top of IterExplorer.
       * It contains the depth-first exploration strategy in a hardwired fashion. Actually this effect is achieved
       * by defining a specific way how to \em combine the results of an \em exploration -- the latter being the
       * function which generates the data structure. To yield a depth-first exploration, all we have to do
       * is to delve down immediately into the children, right after visiting the node itself.
       * 
       * Now, when creating such a DepthFirstExplorer by wrapping a given source iterator, the result is again
       * an iterator, but a specific iterator which at the same time is a Monad: It supports the \c >>= operation
       * (also known as \em bind operator or \em flatMap operator). This operator takes as second argument a
       * function, which in our case is the function to generate or explore the data structure.
       * 
       * The result of applying this \c >>= operation is a \em transformed version of the source iterator,
       * i.e. it is again an iterator, which yields the results of the exploration function, combined together
       * in the order as defined by the built-in exploration strategy (here: depth first)
       * 
       * @note technical detail: the result type of the exploration function (here \c exploreChildren() ) determines
       *       the iterator type used within IterExplorer and to drive the evaluation. The source sequence used to
       *       seed the evaluation process can actually be any iterator yielding assignment compatible values: The
       *       second example uses a NumberSequence with unsigned int values 0..6, while the actual expansion and
       *       evaluation is based on NumberSeries using signed int values.

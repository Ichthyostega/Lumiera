/** @file vgsuppression.c
 ** dummy executable to generate _valgrind suppressions_.
 ** When running code under `valgrind` to detect memory leaks, typically a well known set
 ** of false alarms will be reported. The reason is that some facilities, either implemented
 ** by our own or from third party libraries, just choose never to free some working buffers.
 ** To deal with this well known issue, `valgrind` allows to be "primed" with a specifically
 ** crafted executable, which deliberately triggers just these false memory leak alarms.

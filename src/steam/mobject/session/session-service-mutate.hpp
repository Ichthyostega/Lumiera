/** @file session-service-mutate.hpp
 ** Implementation level session API: add or remove Session contents.
 ** This specialised service is intended to be used by MObjectRef,
 ** in order to attach a new Placement to the session or to detach
 ** and purge an existing Placement. An implementation of this service
 ** service is available through the SessionServices access mechanism,
 ** and delegates the actual implementation to the PlacementIndex,
 ** which is the core session datastructure.
 ** 
 ** @see session-impl.hpp implementation of the service
 ** @see session-services.cpp implementation of access

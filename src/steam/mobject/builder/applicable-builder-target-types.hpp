/** @file applicable-builder-target-types.hpp
 ** Declaration of all kinds of MObjects to be treated by some "Builder tool".
 ** This is part of Lumiera's visitation mechanism: Individual MObject subclasses
 ** may declare by the \c DEFINE_PROCESSABLE_BY macro to be specifically processable
 ** by a builder tool (visitor). On the other hand, any concrete builder tool (visitor)
 ** is free to define a \c treat(Type) function for each of these specific subclasses.
 ** If the tool doesn't define such a specific \c treat(..) function, the next suitable
 ** function for a supertype will be used.
 ** 
 ** Now there needs to be \em one location where all the specific kinds of treat-able
 ** MObjects are declared together (in a typelist). Moreover, we need the full declaration
 ** of these classes. This is the catch of using the visitor pattern. Thus, any class
 ** to be treated \em specifically (as opposed to be just treated through a supertype
 ** or super interface) has two liabilities:
 ** - DEFINE_PROCESSABLE_BY
 ** - declare the type here in this file, including the header.
 ** 
 ** @note actually the ApplicableBuilderTargetTypes template, when used (as a baseclass
 **       of any concrete builder tool, causes the generation of the necessary
 **       dispatcher tables used by our visitor implementation.
 **       
 ** @see buildertool.hpp
 ** @see buildertooltest.hpp

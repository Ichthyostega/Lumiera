/** @file engine-ctx.hpp
 ** Dependency context to hold global parameters and services for the render engine.
 ** Notably the services to provide access to working buffers are linked directly into the
 ** render node connectivity, where they are used for each invocation of a render job.
 ** 
 ** The EngineCtx itself is meant to be [dependency injected](\ref lib::Depend), so that
 ** tests can use suitably adapted variants for verifications. The default instantiation
 ** provides a naive self-contained implementation suitable for demonstration and test.
 ** @todo who is responsible for setup of the services for the actual render engine?
 **       Might be closely related to brining up fa√ßade interfaces.
 ** @todo WIP-WIP 10/2024 provide render node structures
 ** 
 ** @see engine-ctx-facilities.hpp implementation
 ** @see buffer-provider.hpp
 ** @see buffhandle.hpp

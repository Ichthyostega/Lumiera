/** @file mutation-message.hpp
 ** Message on the UI-Bus to cause changes on the targeted [UI-Element](\ref Tangible).
 ** The UI-Bus offers a dedicated API to direct MutationMessages towards Tangible elements,
 ** as designated by the given ID. Actually, such messages serve as capsule to transport a
 ** diff-sequence -- since a diff sequence as such is always concrete and tied to a specific context,
 ** we can not represent it directly as an abstract type on interface level. The receiver of a diff
 ** sequence must offer the ability to be reshaped through diff messages, which is expressed through
 ** the interface DiffMutable. In the case at question here, gui::model::Tangible offers this interface
 ** and thus the ability to construct a concrete lib::diff::TreeMutator, which in turn is bound to the
 ** internals of the actual UI-Element. Together this allows for a generic implementation of MutationMessage
 ** handling, where the designated UI-Element is reshaped by applying an embedded concrete diff message
 ** with the help of a `DiffApplicator<DiffMutable>`, based on the TreeMutator exposed.
 ** 
 ** ## Creating mutation messages
 ** The UI-Bus invocation actually takes a reference to MutationMessage, and thus on usage a
 ** concrete instance needs to be created. This concrete Message embeds an actual diff sequence,
 ** which is some iterable sequence of lib::diff::DiffStep records.
 ** @warning be sure to understand that the diff sequence is really moved away and then consumed.
 ** 
 ** @see [AbstractTangible_test]

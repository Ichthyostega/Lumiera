/** @file controller/playback-controller.hpp
 ** This file contains the definition of the playback controller object.
 ** 
 ** @deprecated this represents an early design of playback and will be reworked
 ** @remarks what we actually need is a PlaybackController as a shell or proxy
 **     to maintain a flexible link to ongoing processes in the core. But note,
 **     this is also related to the Displayer service, which needs to be offered
 **     by the UI, so we create a mutual dependency here, and there is not much
 **     that can be done about this.
 ** @warning as a temporary solution, 1/2017 the playback controller was moved
 **     into the viewer panel. Of course it can not work that way....
 ** @todo create a durable PlaybacController design    //////////////////////////////////////////////////////TICKET #1072

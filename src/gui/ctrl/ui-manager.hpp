/** @file ui-manager.hpp
 ** Manager for global user interface concerns and global state.
 ** The central UiManager instance is owned by the GtkLumiera object and initialised in GTK-main.
 ** It establishes and wires the top-level entities of the UI-Layer and thus, indirectly offers
 ** services to provide Icons and other resources, to open and manage workspace windows, to
 ** form and issue (global) actions and to delve into the UI representation of top-level parts
 ** of the session model. Notable connections established herein:
 ** - connection to the [UI-Bus](\ref ui-bus.hpp)
 ** - the global Actions available though the menu
 ** - the WindowList
 ** - the InteractionDirector (top-level controller)
 ** - the StyleManager
 ** 
 ** @see gtk-lumiera.hpp
 ** @see ui-bus.hpp

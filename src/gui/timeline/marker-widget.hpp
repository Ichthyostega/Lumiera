/** @file marker-widget.hpp
 ** Widget to show a marker at various places.
 ** Markers are attached by placement and serve as a reference point, for navigation,
 ** for special functions, but also to be referenced by other placements. The display
 ** of a marker is just a label, typically abridged. But the MarkerWidget itself
 ** participates in the structural model of the UI and thus is a model::Tangible and
 ** may receive messages over the UI-Bus.

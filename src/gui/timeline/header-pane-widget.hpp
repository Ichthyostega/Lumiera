/** @file header-pane-widget.hpp
 ** Widget to show an always visible track header area within the timeline UI.
 ** [The fork](\ref session::Fork), a recursively nested system of scopes, is rendered within
 ** the timeline display as a system of nested tracks. Each of these tracks possibly holds some
 ** child tracks plus some actual media clips, which all inherit parameters of placement from
 ** this fork ("track"). These parameters address various aspects of how content is attached
 ** ("placed") into the model at large. So, for each track, we create a
 ** ["patchbay" area](\ref timeline::PatchbayWidget) to manage those placement parameters.
 ** 
 ** The HeaderPaneWidget aggregates those patchbay elements into a nested, collapsable tree
 ** structure in accordance with the nesting of scopes. For the actual layout, it has to collaborate
 ** with the timeline::LayoutManager to work out the space available for each individual track head
 ** and to keep these parts aligned with the tracks in the [timeline body](BodyCanvasWidget).
 ** 
 ** @todo WIP-WIP-WIP as of 12/2016

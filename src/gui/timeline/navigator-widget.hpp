/** @file navigator-widget.hpp
 ** Widget for navigation controls within the timeline UI.
 ** Since the timeline is effectively some kind of table grid, with a track header pane
 ** on the right and the timeline body display to the left, and since the latter has a
 ** [time ruler](\ref timeline::RulerWidget) running along it's top, there is a basically
 ** unused screen area in the first cell within the typical timeline layout of any media
 ** handling application. Lumiera uses this area to render a navigation control, since
 ** the player control (which also would be a natural choice of usage for this area) is
 ** already located in the timeline pane's general toolbar, or alternatively in the
 ** viewer pane. Since this area is always prominently visible, it is very attractive
 ** for global navigation controls

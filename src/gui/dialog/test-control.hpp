/** @file test-control.hpp
 ** Non-modal dialog window to trigger diagnostics and self test routines.
 ** This window can be launched from the help menu as child window of the current
 ** top-level workspace window and stays outside of the regular window and perspective
 ** management of the Lumiera UI. This window allows for quick-n-dirty development
 ** helper routines to be hooked up easily within the UI. Actions launched from here
 ** perform within the same environment as regular user interactions.
 ** 
 ** @todo as of 9/2018, this is a first rough draft, relevant for #1099          ////////////////////////////TICKET #1074 gradually augment the self-diagnostics controls in the UI
 ** @todo this header also features a design draft how to simplify building notebook widgets.
 **       Which could be polished and moved into a separate utility header eventually.

  /**
   * Helper widget to simplify construction and wiring of a [Notebook] widget.
   * Gtk::Notebook is quite powerful container foundation to build complex dialog widgets with
   * multiple pages on tabs. However, the construction, wiring an setup is notoriously tedious,
   * due to the repetitiveness and the sheer amount of child widgets spread over various pages.
   * 
   * This design draft is an attempt to mitigate the required boilerplate, without overly much
   * obscuring the structure. The basic idea is to package each page into a locally defined child
   * struct, which is actually heap allocated and managed automatically. This way, each child page
   * gets its own namespace, and wiring to other components is made explicit by passing named ctor
   * arguments -- while the overall structure  of building and wiring of widgets stays close to the
   * habits of [programming with GTKmm](https://developer.gnome.org/gtkmm-tutorial/stable/).
   * - define the pages as custom widgets, typically just as locally known struct types
   * - invoke #buildPage passing the type and tab label for each page
   * - define the wiring of the components within a page in the page's ctor
   * - possibly pass external dependencies for wiring into that ctor
   * @note the page widgets are actually heap allocated and managed automatically
   * @see gui::dialog::TestControl as a usage example

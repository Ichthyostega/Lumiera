/** @file basic-setup.hpp
 ** Bootstrap and self-configuration of the application at startup.
 ** The class BasicSetup represents the very basic self-configuration
 ** of the application at start-up. This bootstrap is based on some
 ** conventions for the application to "find its parts".
 ** 
 ** # Motivation: why a bootstrap convention?
 ** We want Lumiera to be usable _without the need of a set-up._
 ** Since the application is meant to be used in media production, users
 ** often have to work in temporary and varying environments. In such a
 ** situation, it is desirable just to "unzip and start" an application
 ** bundle. On the other hand, obviously we want to create a nice and
 ** proper, FSH compliant application, which can be packaged and installed
 ** in a modern Linux distribution as first class citizen. We can fulfil
 ** both demands by establishing a convention how the application can
 ** discover the very basic parts necessary to start up into the `main()`
 ** function and read a setup configuration. This setup configuration
 ** in turn supports the definition of _search paths_ -- which then
 ** allows us to deliver the application in a bundle structure which
 ** both can be run from a single root folder and likewise easily
 ** be mapped into FSH compliant installation folders by the
 ** packager.

/** @file binding.hpp
 ** A pattern to define and identify a specific attachment to the Advice system.
 ** This pattern is comprised of a predicate list and intended to be matched or unified
 ** against a similar pattern associated with the attachment of a possible collaboration partner.
 ** Semantically, this list of atoms forms an conjunction of predicates to be resolved against 
 ** similar predicates of the partner. Informally, when two entities attach to the Advice system,
 ** each specifying a binding, they can be paired up if any condition included into the binding
 ** holds true for both sides.
 ** 
 ** Typically, a binding includes a \em type-guard predicate \c advice.type.xx where \c xx is an 
 ** identifier denoting a type used within an instantiation of the Advice collaboration, i.e. a type
 ** used as advice value in a instantiation of the PointOfAdvice<AD> template. Besides the type guard,
 ** a binding may narrow down the topic of the advice by providing further predicates. This allows for
 ** Advice collaborations targeted at a more specific topic. The goal and intention behind this Advice
 ** system is to allow collaboration of entities without requiring them to be tightly coupled. Indeed,
 ** the only dependency besides the common type used as advice is to know any specific topic used
 ** within the binding. Thus, and advisor entity could put up a piece of advice, i.e. a value of
 ** the advice type, and another client entity (the advised entity) could pick up this value
 ** without the need to now anything about the advisor.
 ** 
 ** \par implementation notes
 ** Any binding will be normalised prior to further processing. This normalisation is based
 ** on ordering by predicate symbol and arity. Patterns just comprised of constant symbols
 ** (nullary atoms) can even be condensed into a single hash value, which allows for fast
 ** match checking. For each pattern, we provide a matcher functor, allowing to check
 ** a match against this pattern. In case of the mentioned symbol-only patterns,
 ** this matcher will just hold the hash value of the normalised pattern.
 ** 
 ** The advice system uses a binding index datastructure to keep track of any participating
 ** patterns and especially of the matching pairs. Actually, this datastructure needs to store
 ** only these matcher functors; thus, for a new binding to be used within the advice system,
 ** the symbolic definition is parsed, then normalised and finally, after creating the matcher
 ** functor, the full pattern definition can be discarded.
 ** 
 ** @remarks while binding is defined in the context of the advice system for now,
 **       obviously this is the foundation of a more generic system to deal with predicate terms. 
 ** @note as of 4/2010 this is an experimental setup and implemented just enough to work out
 **       the interfaces. Ichthyo expects this collaboration service to play a central role
 **       at various places within proc-layer.
 ** @todo for now, \em only the case of a completely constant (ground) pattern is implemented.
 **       Later we may consider to extend the binding patterns to allow variables, which, on match
 **       could be fed as parameters to the bound advice. But this extension requires to extend
 **       the simple hash-based match check to an actual unification of the patterns. ///TICKET #615

/** @file subsys.hpp
 ** Describing dependencies and lifecycle of the application's primary parts.
 ** Within Lumiera's main(), a small number of well-known application subsystems
 ** need to be started and maintained, observing some interrelations.
 ** While the activation of the key components is controlled by options, maybe
 ** some prerequisite subsystems need to be pulled up, and in case of an regular
 ** or irregular exit of a given subsystem, the whole dependency graph needs 
 ** to be brought down in a clean manner. The purpose of lumiera::Subsys is
 ** to maintain these in a self-explanatory script-like fashion within main(),
 ** without forcing the individual subsystems into a fixed implementation scheme.
 ** The only requirement is that for each subsystem there is sort-of an entry
 ** point or facade object, providing a Subsys descriptor instance to be
 ** used within main. 
 **
 ** @see lumiera::AppState
 ** @see lumiera::Option
 ** @see main.cpp

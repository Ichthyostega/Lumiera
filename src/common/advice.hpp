/** @file advice.hpp
 ** Expecting Advice and giving Advice: a cross-cutting collaboration of loosely coupled participants.
 ** This header exposes the basics of the advice system and the public access points. The advice system
 ** is a system wide singleton service, but clients never talk directly to this singleton; rather they
 ** use advice::Provision and advice::Request as access point.
 ** 
 ** \par Advice collaboration pattern
 ** Advice collaboration is a special pattern of interaction extracted from multiple use cases within
 ** Lumiera. Creating this abstraction was partially inspired by aspect oriented programming, especially
 ** the idea of cross-cutting the primary dependency hierarchy. Another source of inspiration where the
 ** various incarnations of properties with dynamic binding. For defining the actual binding, we rely
 ** on predicate notation and matching (planned: unification) as known from rule based systems.
 ** 
 ** <b>Definition</b>: Advice is an optional, mediated collaboration between entities taking on
 ** the roles of advisor and advised, thereby passing a custom piece of advice data, managed by
 ** the advice support system. The possibility of advice is created by both of the collaborators
 ** entering the system, where the advised entity exposes a point of advice, while the advising
 ** entity provides an actual advice value.
 ** 
 ** \par Collaborators
 ** - the advised entity
 ** - the advisor
 ** - point of advice
 ** - advice system
 ** - the binding
 ** - the advice
 ** 
 ** Usually, the \em advised entity opens the collaboration by requesting an advice. The \em advice itself
 ** is a piece of data of a custom type, which needs to be copyable. Obviously, both the advised and the
 ** advisor need to share knowledge about the meaning of this advice data. The actual advice collaboration
 ** happens at a \em point-of-advice, which needs to be derived first. To this end, the advised puts up an
 ** \em request by providing his \em binding, which is a pattern for matching. An entity about to give advice
 ** opens possible advice \em channels by putting up an advisor binding, which similarly is a pattern. The
 ** advice \em system as mediator resolves both sides, by matching (which in the most general case could be
 ** an unification). This process creates an advice point \em solution -- allowing the advisor to fed the
 ** piece of advice into the advice channel, causing it to be placed into the point of advice. After passing
 ** a certain (implementation defined) break point, the advice leaves the influence of the advisor and gets
 ** exposed to the advised entities. Especially this involves copying the advice data into a location managed
 ** by the advice system. In the standard case, the advised entity accesses the advice synchronously and
 ** non-blocking. Typically, the advice data type is default constructible and thus there is always a basic
 ** form of advice available, thereby completely decoupling the advised entity from the timings related
 ** to this collaboration.
 ** 
 ** \par interfaces and implementation
 ** Client code is assumed to interface solely through the advice::Request and advice::Provision classes,
 ** which both can be instantiated and copied freely, may be used as member or mixed in as baseclass.
 ** The AdviceSystem on the other hand is an implementation facility (actually a singleton) and lives
 ** in the advice.cpp translation unit. The interface entities inherit protected from AdviceLink,
 ** which is implemented in the same scope as the AdviceSystem and thus allowed to talk to it
 ** directly. The AdviceSystem in turn uses advice::Index to keep track of the collaboration
 ** partners, which, for this purpose, are handled as type-erased PointOfAdvice elements.
 ** The latter class contains 4 API functions used by the index to manage solutions. 
 ** 
 ** @note as of 6/2010 this is an experimental setup and implemented just enough to work out
 **       the interfaces and gain practical usage experiences. Ichthyo expects this collaboration
 **       service to play a central role at various places within proc-layer.
 ** @todo allow variables in binding patterns
 ** @todo use the lumiera MPool instead of heap allocations
 ** @todo consider to provide variations of the basic behaviour by policy classes
 ** @todo the implementation is generic/defensive, and could be improved and optimised
 ** 
 ** @see AdviceBasics_test usage example
 ** @see advice.cpp implementation
 ** @see advice::Index index datastructure

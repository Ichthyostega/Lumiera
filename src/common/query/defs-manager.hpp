/** @file defs-manager.hpp
 ** Management of defaults and default rules.
 ** It is one of the central ideas to shape the behaviour of Lumiera
 ** not through hard wired procedures, but rather by the combination of
 ** pattern elements driven by rules. A key element within this approach
 ** is the notion of an *default*: Whenever some concrete calculation or
 ** behaviour needs an additional element as missing link, in order to
 ** reach its intrinsic goals, we (the developers) ask ourselves if the
 ** for of this additional element can be derived from first principles
 ** or if it is already determined by the input set driving the operation.
 ** If this is _not_ the case (and the expectation is that most elements
 ** are not fully determined), then we _query for an default._ This pattern
 ** creates a lot of implicit extension points, which are safe to use, since
 ** they are defined on a logical level. We ask for something to fulfil a
 ** given contract.
 ** 
 ** Contrast this to a system, which just has arbitrarily built-in flexibility
 ** by parametrisation variables: such systems are known to be brittle, since
 ** the _parameter values_ are implicitly tied to the behaviour of the operation
 ** through _shared knowledge_ of implementation details. It requires both
 ** "Druid knowledge" and an overall focus on the implementation mechanics to
 ** adjust such parameters. In this respect, a logical query for defaults is
 ** quite different, insofar it forces the implementation to respect abstractions
 ** on a very fine grained level, and it allows to express the actual defaults
 ** by rules which talk the language of the usage context, not the implementation
 ** context. The user shall be able to define generic (logical) rules how the
 ** Session should behave for the given editing project. And by combination
 ** with an additional set of logical consistency rules, a resolution engine
 ** can figure out what would be the right _default element_ to use at a
 ** given point in the implementation.
 ** 
 ** @note as of 2017, we are far from such a system, but it is of uttermost
 **       importance that we build our implementations with this goal in mind
 ** 
 ** # Configuration Query Interface
 ** The [Defaults Manager](\ref DefsManager) exposes an interface similar to
 ** a database. The intended audience of this interface is the writer of
 ** low-level implementation code. This facade interface is meant to create
 ** a more familiar front-end to an essentially logic and rules driven
 ** configuration system. And, as an additional benefit, it can be implemented
 ** just by a glorified table lookup. Which indeed is what we do until the more
 ** elaborate rules based system is in place.
 ** 
 ** An implementation process in need for some missing link typically knows the
 ** _type of that missing element._ Which means, this type is possibly an abstract
 ** type and defines the contract any solution has to fulfil. Thus, the usage context
 ** can just demand "give me a suitable XYZ!". In practice, there are several flavours
 ** to this interaction, each of which is expressed by a dedicated method on the
 ** DefsManager facade interface:
 ** - we can just *retrieve* a suitable solution element, no questions asked.
 ** - we can *query* for a suitable solution, while limiting the search to what
 **   is already known and defined. This entails the possibility that there is
 **   no known solution yet.
 ** - we can *demand to fabricate* a suitable solution element. Such a call might
 **   still deliver something already fabricated, but the emphasis is on the
 **   "make it so" demand.
 ** - we can *provide and associate* a solution element we created ourselves,
 **   to be available from now on, and associated with a given query. Even
 **   this call implicates the necessity for the query to be fulfilled by
 **   the given element, which, as a consequence includes the possibility
 **   of failure.
 ** - for sake of completeness, we can also require a specific element to
 **   be purged from knowledge

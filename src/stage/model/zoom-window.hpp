/** @file zoom-window.hpp
 ** Abstraction: a multi-dimensional extract from model space into screen coordinates.
 ** This is a generic component to represent and handle the zooming and positioning of
 ** views within an underlying model space. This model space is conceived to be two fold:
 ** - it is a place or excerpt within the model topology (e.g. the n-th track in the fork)
 ** - it has a temporal extension within a larger temporal frame (e.g. some seconds within the timeline)

 ** [sigc-track]: http://issues.lumiera.org/ticket/940#comment:3 "Ticket #940"
 ** 
 ** @todo WIP-WIP as of 10/2022 the usage is just emerging, while the actual meaning
 **               of this interface still remains somewhat nebulous...

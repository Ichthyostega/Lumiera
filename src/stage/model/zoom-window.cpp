/** @file zoom-window.cpp
 ** Common implementation details related to zoom handling and
 ** transformation into screen coordinates.
 ** @todo do we need this dedicated translation unit?
 **       As of 11/2022, the ZoomWindow component was developed header-only...
 **       However the amount of code is significant and the details are complex,
 **       and there is indeed a major implementation-only block with private functions.

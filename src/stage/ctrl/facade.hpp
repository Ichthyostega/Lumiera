/** @file facade.hpp
 ** Manage the lifecycle of the public UI facade interface(s).
 ** Startup of the UI is a tricky process, which requires to establish a main context and to wire
 ** the right components in the right order, prior to activating the GTK event loop. External interfaces
 ** of the UI-Layer should be activated only after everything is wired properly and after the event loop
 ** is actually operative.
 ** 
 ** @note GTK operates single threaded by design.
 **       For this reason, any call from other parts of the application need to be explicitly
 **       dispatched into the UI event loop. The external fa√ßade interfaces are constructed
 **       appropriately to ensure this constraint is regarded.
 ** 
 ** @see notification-service.hpp
 ** @see ui-manager.hpp

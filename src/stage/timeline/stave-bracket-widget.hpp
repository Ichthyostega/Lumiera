/** @file stave-bracket-widget.hpp
 ** Widget to group tracks visually in the Timeline presentation.
 ** The TrackHeadWidget is structured according to the nested structure of tracks
 ** in the Fork, using nested widgets to represent sub-tracks; in the grid's first column
 ** a graphical structure is rendered to indicate the nesting and connectivity of tracks.
 ** While based on few rather simple visual primitives, this structure need to adapt to
 ** the actual space allocation and positioning of sub-tracks in the layout; technicalities
 ** of actual drawing this structure is abstracted into this custom widget â€” allowing the
 ** track head to indicate the necessary layout constraints generic and recursively.
 ** 
 ** @todo WIP-WIP-WIP as of 2/2023

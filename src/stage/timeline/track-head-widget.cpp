   * @remark The Lumiera Timeline model does not rely on a list of tracks, as most conventional
   * video editing software does -- rather, each sequence holds a _fork of nested scopes._
   * This recursively nested structure is reflected in the patchbay area corresponding to
   * each track in the _header pane_ of the timeline display, located to the left. The
   * patchbay for each track is a grid with initially four quadrants, and the 4th quadrant
   * holds the _content area,_ which is again a TrackHeadWidget. Additional sub-Tracks
   * are added as additional lines to the grid, while nested sub-Tracks will be handled
   * recursively by the corresponding nested TrackHeadWidget.
   * @note Child tracks are always appended. When tracks are reordered or deleted,
   *       the whole structure has to be re-built accordingly.

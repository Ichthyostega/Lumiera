/** @file track-head-widget.cpp
 ** Implementation details regarding display of the track heads within the timeline UI.
 ** 
 ** # Layout arrangement for the Â»PatchbayÂ«
 ** 
 ** In Lumiera, Â»TracksÂ« are arranged as a system of nested scopes.
 ** The TrackHeadWidget thus has to reflect this nested structure, which can be achieved
 ** by recursively nesting further TrackHeadWidget instances. The header and Â»patchbayÂ«
 ** for each scope is implemented as a `Gtk::Grid` widget, with initially three rows:
 ** - a row holding the Track Header label and menu (actually an \ref ElementBoxWidget)
 ** - a row corresponding to the _content area_ of the track itself, to hold the controls
 **   for this track's scope, i.e. the track _together with all nested sub-tracks._
 ** - a padding row to help synchronising track head and track body display.
 ** Additional sub-Tracks are added as additional lines to the grid, while deeper nested
 ** sub-Tracks will be handled by the corresponding nested TrackHeadWidget. The column
 ** to the left side will be increased accordingly to display the nested fork structure.
 ** 
 ** @todo as of 1/2023, the basic structure was (finally) settled and the painting
 **       of vertical space allocation looks correct up to Â± 1px, when testing with
 **       various margin, border and padding settings in the CSS.

/** @file session-command-facade.h
 ** Major public Interface to the Session subsystem of Lumiera GUI.
 ** This interface describes the ability of the Session to trigger the execution
 ** of pre-defined commands, outfitted with suitable arguments and parameters.
 ** Triggering of these commands typically happens in response to some messages
 ** being sent over the UI-Bus. Likewise, external entities (e.g. plug-ins) may
 ** invoke commands over this interface to alter the session.
 ** 
 ** For this reason, the operations exposed here are defined in terms matching
 ** the structure of binding and invocation messages. This goes so far as to
 ** accept the command arguments for binding packaged as `Record<GenNode>`.
 ** For each command, there needs to be a registration record within the
 ** Proc-Layer implementation. The service implementation backing this
 ** facade indeed retrieves the corresponding proc::control::Command
 ** handles to perform the binding operation and hands them over
 ** to the ProcDispatcher for invocation.
 ** 
 ** @see command.hpp
 ** @see session-command-service.hpp implementation
 ** @see proc::control::ProcDispatcher
 ** @see gui::ctrl::CoreService

   * Global access point to invoke commands and cause edit operations within
   * the Session. Any changes to the session are effected by prepared functors
   * bound into a proc::control::Command registration. A command instance will
   * first be outfitted with suitable parameters to define the target and to
   * qualify and elaborate the action, before it can be actually triggered.
   * Commands then go through a queue to be invoked one by one.
   * 
   * The service exposed through this facade offers dedicated support for
   * the _standard command cycle_, as is typically performed from the UI.
   * Such a usage cycle starts with ["opening"](#cycle) a local anonymous
   * clone copy from the global command definition, which is then used
   * in further calls to be outfitted with actual arguments and finally
   * to be handed over to the dispatcher for execution.
   * @warning this standard command cycle is intended for single-threaded
   *          use from the UI. It is not threadsafe. To the contrary, all
   *          operations with globally registered commands are threadsafe.
   * 
   * @remark This is a layer separation facade interface. Clients should
   * use the embedded #facade factory, which yields a proxy to route any
   * calls through the lumieraorg_SessionCommand interface
   * @throws lumiera::error::State when interface is not opened

/** @file gui-notification-facade.h
 ** Major public Interface of the Lumiera GUI. While from a user's point of view,
 ** the GUI controls the application and thus acts on its own, in fact the UI sends
 ** command messages to the Session subsystem in Steam-Layer. These commands cause
 ** changes in the session, which result in notification and structure change messages
 ** being pushed up asynchronously back into the UI. The GuiNotification interface
 ** abstracts this ability of the UI to receive such update messages. It is implemented
 ** by the NotificationService within the GUI Layer, which causes actual tangible changes
 ** to happen in the UI in response to the reception of these messages.
 **
 ** @see notification-service.hpp implementation
 ** @see gui::GuiFacade
 ** @see main.cpp

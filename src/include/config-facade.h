/** @file config-facade.h
 ** The lumiera::Config wrapper class addresses two issues.
 ** First, it registers startup and shutdown hooks to bring up the config system
 ** as early as possible. Later, on application main initialisation, the global
 ** config interface is opened and wrapped for convenient access from C++ code.
 ** 
 ** @note This was created as part of a first draft towards an application
 **       wide configuration system. Later (around 2012) it became clear that
 **       we can not judge the requirements for such a system yet, so we deferred
 **       the topic altogether. Meanwhile, this facade is sporadically used to
 **       mark the necessity to retrieve some "parametrisation values".
 ** @warning as a preliminary solution, the original configuration system draft
 **       was detached and replaced by an _ini file solution_ based on lib Boost.
 ** 
 ** @todo there ought to be an external Interface for the Config subsystem.
 **       But the full-blown Config system isn't implemented yet anyway
 ** 
 ** @see config.h
 ** @see lumiera::AppState
 ** @see main.cpp

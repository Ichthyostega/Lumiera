/** @file threadpool-init.hpp
 ** Automatically bring up the threading management and threadpool in the backend.
 ** This works by registering a lifecycle callback, which is activated at the start
 ** of main or when running the testsuite. Similarly, a shutdown hook is registered.
 ** 
 ** @todo as of 1/10 it is not clear if this will be the final solution.
 **       Alternatively, we may rely on a subsystem "backend" or "threadpool"
 ** 
 ** @see threads.h
 ** @see thread-wrapper.hpp

   * Implemented as a variant-type value object, it is preconfigured
   * with the possible hierarchy-base classes used within this application.
   * Thus, when passing in an arbitrary smart-ptr, the best fitting smart-ptr
   * type pointing to the corresponding base class is selected for internal storage.
   * Later on, stored values can be retrieved either utilising static or dynamic casts;
   * error reporting is similar to the behaviour of dynamic_cast<T>: when retrieving
   * a pointer, NULL is returned in case of mismatch.
   * 
   * @deprecated not sure if this was a good idea anyway. Better re-think how to handle wrapped objects in visitation
   * @todo really need to switch to the new lib::Variant and util::AccessCasted implementation  ////////////////TICKET #450

/** @file microbenchmark.hpp
 ** A function to perform multithreaded timing measurement on a given functor.
 ** This helper simplifies micro benchmarks of isolated implementation details.
 ** The test subject, given as function object or lambda, is copied into N threads
 ** and invoked numerous times within a tight loop. After waiting on termination of
 ** the test threads, results are summed up and then averaged into milliseconds
 ** per single invocation. The actual timing measurement relies on `chrono::duration`,
 ** which means to count micro ticks of the OS.
 ** @warning care has to bee taken when optimisation is involved!
 **     Optimisation usually has quite some impact on the results, but since
 **     this function is inline, the lambda can typically be inlined and the
 **     loop possibly be optimised away entirely. A simple workaround is to
 **     define a _volatile_ variable in the call context, close the lambda
 **     by reference, and perform a comparison with that volatile variable
 **     in each invocation. The compiler is required actually to access the
 **     value of the volatile each time.
 ** @remarks some interesting observations (in my setup, 8 core AMD FX-8350)
 **     - if we replace the global volatile by a local variable within the
 **       test subject, the initialisation of that local typically costs +5ns
 **       per invocation.
 **     - incrementing the volatile costs +10ns
 **     - multithreaded (unlocked) incrementing of the _global_ volatile
 **       creates massive overhead and increases the running time by factor 100.
 **       This nicely confirms that the x86_64 platform has strong cache coherence.

   * This function fires up a number of threads
   * and invokes the given test subject repeatedly.
   * @tparam number of threads to run in parallel
   * @param subject `void(void)` function to be timed
   * @return the averaged invocation time in _mircroseconds_
   * @remarks - the subject function will be _copied_ into each thread
   *          - so `nThreads` copies of this function will run in parallel
   *          - consider locking if this function accesses a shared closure.
   *          - if you pass a lambda, it is eligible for inlining followed
   *            by loop optimisation -- be sure to include some action, like
   *            e.g. accessing a volatile variable, to prevent the compiler
   *            from optimising it away entirely.

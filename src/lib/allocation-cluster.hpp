/** @file allocation-cluster.hpp
 ** Memory management for the low-level model (render nodes network).
 ** The model is organised into temporal segments, which are considered
 ** to be structurally constant and uniform. The objects within each
 ** segment are strongly interconnected, and thus each segment is 
 ** being built in a single build process and is replaced or released
 ** as a whole. AllocationCluster implements memory management to
 ** support this usage pattern.
 ** 
 ** @warning in rework 5/2024 â€” with the goal to simplify the logic,
 **          remove all thread safety and make the implementation
 **          usable as standard conformant allocator for STL.
 **
 ** @see allocation-cluster-test.cpp

  /**
   * A pile of objects sharing common allocation and lifecycle.
   * AllocationCluster owns a number of object families of various types.
   * Each of those contains a initially undetermined (but rather large)
   * number of individual objects, which can be expected to be allocated
   * within a short timespan and which are to be released cleanly on
   * destruction of the AllocationCluster. We provide a service creating
   * individual objects with arbitrary ctor parameters.
   * @warning make sure the objects dtors aren't called and object references
   *          aren't used after shutting down a given AllocationCluster.
   * @todo    implement a facility to control the oder in which
   *          the object families are to be discarded. Currently
   *          they are just purged in reverse order defined by
   *          the first request for allocating a certain type.
   * @todo    should we use an per-instance lock? We can't avoid
   *          the class-wide lock, unless also the type-ID registration
   *          is done on a per-instance base. AllocationCluster is intended
   *          to be used within the builder, which executes in a dedicated
   *          thread. Thus I doubt lock contention could be a problem and
   *          we can avoid using a mutex per instance. Re-evaluate this!
   * @todo    currently all AllocationCluster instances share the same type-IDs.
   *          When used within different usage contexts this leads to some slots
   *          remaining empty, because not every situation uses any type encountered.
   *          wouldn't it be desirable to have multiple distinct contexts, each with
   *          its own set of Type-IDs and maybe also separate locking?
   *          Is this issue worth the hassle?            //////////////////////////////TICKET #169

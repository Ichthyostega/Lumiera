/** @file diff-language.hpp
 ** Fundamental definitions for a representation of changes.
 ** We describe differences in data structures or changes to be applied
 ** in the form of a "linearised diff language". Such a diff can be represented
 ** as a sequence of tokens of constant size. Using a linearised constant size
 ** representation allows to process diff generation and diff application in
 ** a pipeline, enabling maximum decoupling of sender and receiver.
 ** Changes sent as diff message serve as a generic meta-representation to keep
 ** separate and different representations of the same logical structure in sync.
 ** Such an architecture allows for tight cooperation between strictly separated
 ** components, without the need of a fixed, predefined and shared data structure.
 ** 
 ** \par Basic Assumptions
 ** While the \em linearisation folds knowledge about the underlying data structure
 ** down into the actual diff, we deliberately assume that the data to be diffed is
 ** \em structured data. Moreover, we'll assume implicitly that this data is \em typed,
 ** and we'll assume explicitly that the atomic elements in the data structure have a
 ** well-defined identity and can be compared with the \c == operator. We treat those
 ** elements as values, which can be copied and moved cheaply. We include a copy of
 ** all content elements right within the tokens of the diff language, either to
 ** send the actual content data this way, or to serve as redundancy to verify
 ** proper application of the changes at the diff receiver downstream.
 ** 
 ** \par Solution Pattern
 ** The representation of this linearised diff language relies on a specialised form
 ** of the <b>visitor pattern</b>: We assume the vocabulary of the diff language to be
 ** relatively fixed, while the actual effect when consuming the stream of diff tokens
 ** is provided as a private detail of the receiver, implemented as a concrete "Interpreter"
 ** (visitor) of the specific diff language flavour in use. Thus, our implementation relies
 ** on \em double-dispatch, based both on the type of the individual diff tokens and on the
 ** concrete implementation of the Interpreter. Typical usage will employ a DiffApplicator,
 ** so the "interpretation" of the language means to apply it to a target data structure in
 ** this standard case.
 ** 
 ** Due to the nature of double-dispatch, the interpretation of each token requires two
 ** indirections. The first indirection forwards to a handler function corresponding to the
 ** token, while the second indirection uses the VTable of the concrete Interpreter to pick
 ** the actual implementation of this handler function for this specific case. Basically
 ** the individual token ("verb") in the language is characterised by the handler function
 ** it corresponds to (thus the meaning of a \em verb, an operation). To support diagnostics,
 ** each token also bears a string id. And in addition, each token carries a single data
 ** content element as argument. The idea is, that the "verbs", the handler functions and
 ** the symbolic IDs are named alike (use the macro DiffStep_CTOR to define the tokens
 ** in accordance to that rule). Such a combination of verb and data argument is called
 ** a DiffStep, since it represents a single step in the process of describing changes
 ** or transforming a data structure. For example, a list diff language can be built
 ** using the following four verbs:
 ** - pick-next
 ** - insert-new
 ** - delete-next
 ** - find reordered element

 ** @see diff-list-application-test.cpp
 ** @see VerbToken

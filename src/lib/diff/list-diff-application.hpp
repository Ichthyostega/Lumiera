/** @file list-diff-application.hpp
 ** Apply a "list diff" to a concrete sequence of elements in a container.
 ** This header provides specialisation(s) of the DiffApplicationStrategy to
 ** actual containers, choosing an implementation approach suitable for this
 ** specific kind of container. Together with a lib::diff::DiffApplicator,
 ** this allows to receive the description of changes (as a linearised sequence
 ** of DiffStep tokens) and apply them to a given concrete sequence of data
 ** elements, thereby transforming the contents of this target sequence.
 ** 
 ** @see diff-list-application-test.cpp

   * and then consumes it step by step, while building up the altered content
   * within the previously emptied target vector. Whenever possible, elements
   * are moved directly to the target location.
   * @throws  lumiera::error::State when diff application fails due to the
   *          target sequence being different than assumed by the given diff.
   * @warning behaves only EX_SANE in case of diff application errors,
   *          i.e. only partially modified / rebuilt sequence might be
   *          in the target when diff application is aborted

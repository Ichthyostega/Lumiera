/** @file diff-mutable.hpp
 ** Abstraction or descriptor interface for a data structure
 ** exposing the ability for mutation by receiving diff messages.
 ** Differences and changes on such data structures can be specified in the form
 ** of a "linearised diff language". Such a diff can be represented as a sequence
 ** of tokens, describing the manipulations necessary to effect the desired change.
 ** While, conceptually, such a diff is drawn against a generic tree like data
 ** description (actually based on diff::Record<GenNode>), with the help of a
 ** customisable intermediary binding layer, it is possible to apply such diff
 ** messages onto data structures otherwise not further disclosed. For this to
 ** work, the target data structure itself must offer the ability to construct
 ** such a suitable intermediary binding layer. This interface declares and
 ** offers this ability.
 ** 
 ** A data structure exposing this interface in one way or the other (which
 ** might be through the help of an ADL bound free function) thus offers some kind
 ** of closure, which, when invoked, will build a concrete TreeMutator implementation
 ** into the given working buffer. Obviously, this TreeMutator is then somehow opaquely
 ** wired to the data structure so to be able to invoke transforming operations on
 ** this target data. Here, the TreeMutator interface defines the primitive operations
 ** necessary to apply a conforming diff message onto this otherwise private data
 ** structure. Based on such a setup, client code may create a DiffApplicator
 ** to embody this custom TreeMutator, which in the end allows to consume
 ** diff messages, thereby transforming and mutating the target data
 ** structure without the need to know any internal details.

/** @file tree-diff-mutator-binding.cpp
 ** Implementation of diff application to unspecific private data structures.
 ** This binding is the link between a generic interpreter for our
 ** »tree diff language« and a concrete TreeMutator implementation,
 ** as provided by the target data structure. We do not require much
 ** additional knowledge regarding the opaque target structure, beyond
 ** the ability to construct such a customised TreeMutator. For this reason,
 ** the implementation is mostly generic and thus can be emitted here within
 ** the library module -- with the exception of the ctor, which indeed picks
 ** up some specifics of the concrete usage situation and thus needs to be
 ** generated in usage context.
 ** 
 ** @see tree-diff.cpp
 ** @see tree-diff-mutator-binding.cpp

/** @file tree-diff-application.hpp
 ** Concrete implementation to apply structural changes to hierarchical
 ** data structures. Together with the generic #DiffApplicator, this allows
 ** to receive linearised structural diff descriptions and apply them to
 ** a given target data structure, to effect the corresponding changes.
 ** 
 ** ## Design considerations
 ** While -- conceptually -- our tree diff handling can be seen as an extension
 ** and generalisation of list diffing, the decision was \em not to embody this
 ** extension into the implementation technically, for sake of clarity. This would
 ** be implementation re-use, as opposed to building a new viable abstraction.
 ** No one outside the implementation realm would benefit from such an abstraction,
 ** so we prefer to understand the tree diff language as the abstraction, which
 ** needs to embodied into two distinct contexts of implementation. So the list diff
 ** application strategy can be seen as blueprint and demonstration of principles.
 ** 
 ** ### Use cases
 ** Initially, we'd have to distinguish two usage situations
 **  - apply a diff to a generic tree representation, based on Record<GenNode>
 **  - apply a diff to some tree shaped implementation data structure.
 ** _Conceptually_ we use the former as blueprint and base to define the semantics
 ** of our »tree-diff language«, while the latter is an extension and can be supported
 ** within the limits of precisely these tree-diff semantics. That is, we support diff
 ** application to all implementation data structures which are _conceptually congruent_
 ** to the generic tree representation. This extension happens in accordance to the
 ** goals of our "diff framework", since we want to allow collaboration between
 ** loosely coupled subsystems, without the need of a shared data structure.
 ** 
 ** ### Implementation
 ** On the implementation level though, relations are the other way round: the
 ** framework and technique to enable applying a diff onto private implementation data
 ** is used also to apply the diff onto the (likewise private) implementation of our
 ** generic tree representation. Because the common goal is loose coupling, we strive
 ** at imposing as few requirements or limitations onto the implementation as possible.
 ** 
 ** Rather we require the implementation to provide a _binding,_ which can then be used
 ** to _execute_ the changes as dictated by the incoming diff. But since this binding
 ** has to consider intricate details of the diff language's semantics and implementation,
 ** we provide a *Builder DSL*, so the client may assemble the concrete binding from
 ** preconfigured building blocks for the most common cases
 ** - binding "attributes" to object fields
 ** - binding "children" to a STL collection of values
 ** - binding especially to a collection of GenNode elements,
 **   which basically covers also the generic tree representation.
 ** 
 ** #### State and nested scopes
 ** For performance reasons, the diff is applied _in place_, directly mutating the
 ** target data structure. This makes the diff application _stateful_ -- and in case of
 ** a *diff conflict*, the target *will be corrupted*.
 ** 
 ** Our tree like data structures are conceived as a system of nested scopes. Within
 ** each scope, we have a list of elements, to which a list-diff is applied. When commencing
 ** diff application, a one time adapter and intermediary is constructed: the TreeMutator.
 ** This requires the help of the target data structure to set up the necessary bindings,
 ** since the diff applicator as such has no knowledge about the target data implementation.
 ** At this point, the existing (old) contents of the initial scope are moved away into an
 ** internal _source sequence buffer,_ from where they may be "picked" and moved back into
 ** place step by step through the diff. After possibly establishing a new order, inserting
 ** or omitting content within a given "object" (Record), the tree diff language allows in
 ** a second step to _open_ some of the child "objects" by entering nested scopes, to effect
 ** further changes within the selected child node. This is done within the `mut(ID)....emu(ID)`
 ** bracketing construct of the diff language. On the implementation side, this recursive
 ** descent and diff application is implemented with the help of a stack, where a new
 ** TreeMutator is constructed whenever we enter (push) a new nested scope.
 ** 
 ** #### Yet another indirection
 ** Unfortunately this leads to yet another indirection layer: Implementing a
 ** language in itself is necessarily a double dispatch (we have to abstract the
 ** verbs and we have to abstract the implementation side). And now we're decoupling
 ** the implementation side from a concrete data structure. Which means, that the user
 ** will have to provide a set of closures (which might even partially be generated
 ** functors) to translate the _implementation actions_ underlying the language into
 ** _concrete actions_ working on local data.
 ** 
 ** #### Generic and variable parts
 ** So there is a link between generic [»tree diff language«](\ref tree-diff.hpp)
 ** interpretation and the concrete yet undisclosed private data structure, and
 ** most of this implementation is entirely generic, since the specifics are
 ** abstracted away behind the TreeMutator interface. For this reason, most of
 ** this _delegating implementation_ can be emitted right here, within the
 ** library module. With the sole exception of the ctor, which needs to
 ** figure out a way how to "get" a suitable TreeMutator implementation
 ** for the given concrete target data.
 ** 
 ** ### the TreeMutator DSL
 ** In the end, for each target structure, a concrete TreeMutator needs to be built
 ** or provided within the realm of the actual data implementation, so the knowledge
 ** about the actual data layout remains confined there. While this requires some
 ** understanding regarding structure and semantics of the diff language, most data
 ** implementation will rely on some very common representation techniques, like using
 ** object fields as "attributes" and a STL collection to hold the "children". Based
 ** on this insight, we provide a DSL with standard adapters and building blocks,
 ** to ease the task of generating ("binding") the actual TreeMutator. The usage site
 ** needs to supply only some functors or lambda expressions to specify how to deal
 ** with the actual representation data values:
 ** - how to construct a new entity
 ** - decide when the binding actually becomes active
 ** - how to determine a diff verb "matches" the actual data
 ** - how to set a value or how to recurse into a sub scope

/** @file tree-mutator-gen-node-binding.hpp
 ** Special binding implementation for TreeMutator, allowing to map
 ** tree diff operations onto an »External Tree Description«. Such is is a
 ** DOM like representation of tree like structures, comprised of GenNode elements.
 ** TreeMutator is a customisable intermediary, which enables otherwise opaque
 ** implementation data structures to receive and respond to generic structural
 ** change messages ("tree diff").
 ** 
 ** Each concrete TreeMutator instance will be configured differently, and this
 ** adaptation is done by implementing binding templates, in the way of building
 ** blocks, layered on top of each other. This header defines a special setup, based
 ** on two layered bindings for STL collections. The reason is that our »External
 ** Tree Description« of object-like structures is comprised of recursively nested
 ** Record<GenNode> to represent "objects", and this representation is actually implemented
 ** internally based on two collections -- one to hold the _attributes_ and one to hold the
 ** _children._ So this special setup relies on implementation inside knowledge to apply
 ** structural changes to such a representation. There is an implicit convention that
 ** "objects" are to be spelled out by first giving the metadata, then enumerating the
 ** attributes (key-value properties) and finally the child elements located within the
 ** scope of this "object" node. This implicit convention is in accordance with the
 ** structure of our _diff language_ -- thus it is sufficient just to layer two collection
 ** bindings, together with suitable closures (lambdas) for layer selection, matching, most
 ** of which is already defined for collections of GenNode elements in general
 ** 
 ** @note the header tree-mutator-collection-binding.hpp was split off for sake of readability
 **       and is included automatically from bottom of tree-mutator.hpp
 ** 
 ** @see _DefaultBinding<GenNode>
 ** @see tree-mutator-collection-binding.hpp
 ** @see tree-mutator-test.cpp

     * Helper to deal with the magic "object type" attribute.
     * Our _meta representation_ for "objects" as Record<GenNode>
     * currently does not support metadata as a dedicated scope (as it should).
     * Rather, the only relevant piece of metadata, an object type ID field, is
     * treated with hard wired code and passed as a _magic attribute_ with key "type".
     * Unfortunately this means for our task here that a plain flat standard binding
     * for the collection of attributes does not suffice -- we need to intercept and
     * grab assignments to this magic attribute to forward them to the dedicated
     * type field found on diff::Record.
     * 
     * Since we build two layers of bindings, with the attributes necessarily on top,
     * this special treatment can be layered as a decorator on top, just overriding
     * the two operations which get to handle assignment to attribute values.

/** @file allocator-handle.hpp
 ** A front-end/concept to allow access to custom memory management.
 ** Minimalistic definition scheme for a functor-like object, which can be
 ** passed to client code, offering a callback to generate new objects into
 ** some custom allocation scheme not further disclosed.
 ** 
 ** Lumiera employs various flavours of custom memory management, to handle
 ** allocation demands from performance critical parts of the application.
 ** Irrespective of the actual specifics of the allocation, typically there
 ** is some _instance_ of an allocator maintained within a carefully crafted
 ** context â€” leading to the necessity to dependency-inject a suitable front-end
 ** into various connected parts of the application, to allow for coherent use
 ** of allocation while avoiding tight coupling of implementation internals.
 ** 
 ** Reduced to the bare minimum, the _ability to allocate_ can be represented
 ** as a functor, which accepts arbitrary (suitable) arguments and returns a
 ** reference to a newly allocated instance of some specific type; such an
 ** _allocation front-end_ may then be passed as additional (template)
 ** parameter to associated classes or functions, allowing to generate new
 ** objects at stable memory location, which can then be wired internally.
 ** 
 ** @todo 6/2023 this specification describes a *Concept*, not an actual
 **       interface type. After the migration to C++20, it will thus be
 **       possible to mark some arbitrary custom allocator / front-end
 **       with such a concept, thereby documenting proper API usage.
 **

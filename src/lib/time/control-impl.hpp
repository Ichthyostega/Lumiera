/** @file control-impl.hpp
 ** Implementation building blocks for time modification and propagation.
 ** The time::Control element allows to impose modifications to a connected
 ** time value entity and at the same time publish the changes to registered
 ** listeners. Due to the various flavours of actual time value entities, this
 ** is a complex undertaking, which is implemented here based on policies and
 ** template metaprogramming. This header/include defines two building blocks:
 ** - the actual Mutator to apply the changes to the target entity
 ** - a Propagator to register listeners and forward the changes.
 ** 
 ** \par implementation technique
 ** 
 ** The Mutator uses functor objects to encapsulate the actual modification
 ** operations. When attaching to a target time entity to be manipulated, these
 ** functor objects will be configured by binding them to the appropriate
 ** implementation function. And picking this actual implementation is done
 ** through a time::mutation::Policy element, using the concrete time entity
 ** types as template parameter. Thus, the actual implementation to be used
 ** is determined by the compiler, through the template specialisations
 ** contained in control-policy.hpp
 ** 
 ** @note the header control-policy.hpp with the template specialisations
 **       is included way down, after the class definitions. This is done
 **       so for sake of readability
 ** 
 ** @see TimeControl_test

   * Implementation building block: impose changes to a Time element.
   * The purpose of the Mutator is to attach a target time entity,
   * which then will be subject to any received value changes,
   * offsets and grid nudging. The actual attachment is to be
   * performed in a subclass, by using the Mutation interface.
   * When attaching to a target, the Mutator will be outfitted 
   * with a set of suitable functors, incorporating the specific
   * behaviour for the concrete combination of input changes
   * ("source values") and target object type. This works by
   * binding to the appropriate implementation functionality,
   * guided by a templated policy class. After installing
   * these functors, these decisions remains opaque and
   * encapsulated within the functor objects, so the
   * mutator object doesn't need to carry this 
   * type information on the interface

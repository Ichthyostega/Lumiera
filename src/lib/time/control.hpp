/** @file control.hpp
 ** Manipulating and monitoring time entities with life changes.
 ** This is an control- and callback element to handle any kind of "running"
 ** time entities. This element is to be provided by the client and then attached
 ** to the target time entity as a time::Mutation. Internally, a life connection to
 ** the target is built, allowing both to 
 ** - to manipulate the target by invoking the function operator
 ** - to receive change notifications by installing a callback functor.
 ** 
 ** The actual type of the changes and modifications is specified as template parameter;
 ** when later attached to some time entity as a Mutation, the actual changes to be performed
 ** depend both on this change type and the type of the target time entity (double dispatch).
 ** The behaviour is similar to applying a static time::Mutation
 ** 
 ** \par relevance
 ** This control element is intended to be used for all kinds of editing and monitoring
 ** of time-like entities -- be it the running time display in a GUI widget, a ruler marker
 ** which can be dragged, a modifiable selection or the animated playhead cursor.
 ** 
 ** \par usage scenarios
 ** The time::Control element provides mediating functionality, but doesn't assume or provide
 ** anything special regarding the usage pattern or the lifecycle, beyond the ability to
 ** attach listeners, attach to a (different) target and to detach from all connections.
 ** Especially, no assumptions are made about which side is the server or the client
 ** and who owns the time::Control element.
 ** 
 ** Thus an interface might accept a time::Control element \em reference (e.g. the
 ** lumiera::Play::Controller uses this pattern) -- meaning that the client owns the
 ** Control element and might attach listeners, while the implementation (server side)
 ** will attach the Control to mutate a time value entity otherwise not disclosed
 ** (e.g. the playhead position of the playback process). Of course, in this case
 ** the client is responsible for keeping the Control element and all listeners
 ** alive, and to invoke Control#disconnect prior to destroying the element.
 ** 
 ** Of course, the reversed usage situation would be possible as well: an interface
 ** may expose a time::Control, thus allowing to attach target and listeners, while the
 ** actual changes will originate somewhere within the opaque service implementation.
 ** 
 ** Another usage pattern would be to expose a time::Control \c const&, allowing only to
 ** impose changes, but not to change the target or listener attachments. To the contrary,
 ** when exposing only a time::Mutation \c const& through an interface allows only to
 ** attach new target elements, but not to change listeners or feed any value changes.
 ** 
 ** Using time::Control as an implementation building block and just exposing the
 ** change (function) operators or the listener attachment through an forwarding sub
 ** interface is another option.
 ** 
 ** @note time::Control is default constructible and freely copyable.
 ** 
 ** 
 ** \par changing quantised (grid aligned) time entities
 ** 
 ** The time::Control element includes the functionality to handle grid aligned time values,
 ** both as target and as change/notification value. This ability is compiled in conditionally,
 ** as including mutation.hpp causes several additional includes, which isn't desirable when
 ** it comes just to changing plain time values. Thus, to get these additional specialisations,
 ** the LIB_TIME_TIMEQUQNT_H header guard needs to be defined, which happens automatically
 ** if lib/time/mutation.hpp is included prior to lib/time/control.hpp.
 ** 
 ** \par implementation notes
 ** - the validity of a given combination of change and target is checked immediately,
 **   when connecting to the target. Depending on the situation, the actual changes later
 **   are subject to specific treatment (e.g. frame quantisation)
 ** - by default time::Control is <b>not threadsafe</b>. But, as each change is basically
 **   processed within its own call context (function invocation), parallelism is only
 **   a concern with respect to the value finally visible within the target.
 ** - the change notification is processed right away, after applying the change to the
 **   target; of course there is a race between applying the value and building the
 **   response value passed on as notification. In all cases, the effective change
 **   notification value is built from the state of the target after applying
 **   the change, which might or might not reflect the change value passed in.
 ** 
 ** @todo include support for QuTimeSpan values                               ////////////////////TICKET #760

/** @file time/diagnostics.hpp
 ** Extension to the lib::time::Time wrapper, adding output and further
 ** diagnostic aids. This shouldn't be confused with formatting into
 ** distinctive \em Timecode formats. There is an elaborate framework
 ** for the latter: basically you'd need first to create a frame quantised
 ** time value (QuTime) -- from there you can build various timecode
 ** representations.
 ** 
 ** To the contrary, the purpose of this header is to help with debugging,
 ** writing unit tests and similar diagnostic activities.
 ** 
 ** @see timevalue.hpp
 ** @see lumitime-test.cpp

/** @file variant.hpp
 ** This file defines a simple alternative to boost::variant.
 ** It pulls in fewer headers and has a shorter code path, but also
 ** doesn't deal with alignment issues and is <b>not threadsafe</b>. 
 ** 
 ** Values can be stored using \c operator= . In order to access the value
 ** stored in lib::Variant, you additionally need to define an access "functor" 
 ** - with a typedef "Ret" for the return type
 ** - providing a `static Ret access(ELM&)` function
 **   for each of the types used in the Variant</li>
 ** 
 ** @todo the instance handling for the accessor seems somewhat
 **       misaligned: why do we create another accessor as static var
 **       within the access() function?? Why not putting that into the
 **       Holder::Storage instance created by the client code?
 ** @todo write an unit test   ///////////////////////////////////////TICKET #141
 ** @see wrapperptr.hpp usage example

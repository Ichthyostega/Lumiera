/** @file typed-counter.hpp
 ** Creating series of type-based contexts.
 ** The idea is to get a "slot" for any given type, so we can build
 ** tables or families of implementations based on these types. Each of
 ** those "slots" can be addressed by a distinct (compile time) type, but
 ** at the same time holds a numeric ID (runtime assigned on demand). This
 ** setup allows to bridge between metaprogramming and (runtime) dispatcher tables.
 ** 
 ** Each such series of type-id-slots is associated to a distinct usage context.
 ** Those usage contexts are discerned by the template parameter \c CX. Each of
 ** these usage contexts uses a separate numbering scheme on his own, i.e. every
 ** new type encountered at runtime gets the next higher ID number (slot).
 ** @warning the actual ID numbers depend on the sequence of first encountering
 **          a given type. If this sequence isn't reproducible between runs, then
 **          also the generated type-IDs aren't reproducible. Thus its advisable
 **          \em not to rely on any specific numeric value here, but always just
 **          access the service through the type slots.
 ** @note Locking is based on a class lock per usage context, but a lock needs
 **       only be acquired to allocate a new ID number (double checked locking).
 **       Thus lock contention is considered not to be a problem, yet we need
 **       actually to verify this by real measurements (as of 2011)
 ** @todo 2010 ... this is the first, preliminary version of a facility,
 **       which is expected to get quite important for custom allocation management.
 ** 
 ** @see typed-counter-test.cpp
 ** @see TypedAllocationManager
 ** @see AllocationCluster (custom allocation scheme using a similar idea inline)

  /**
   * Provide an implicit conversion to "bool".
   * Inherit (mix-in) from this template by providing the
   * concrete subclass type ("CRTP"). Additionally, to implement
   * the specific logic of this bool check, the subclass using this
   * template must provide a public function \c isValid() 
   * 
   * \par safe bool conversion
   * Generally speaking, a direct automatic conversion to bool would be 
   * a dangerous feature, because bool is considered an "integral type" in C.
   * Thus, you'd not only get the ability to write very expressive checks
   * like \c if(object) -- you would also get automatic conversions to int
   * where you'd never expect them. In C++ there is a well-known idiom to
   * circumvent this problem. Unfortunately, this idiom isn't easy to 
   * grasp, involving the convoluted syntax of member pointers.
   * So we try to hide away these details into a mixin.
   * 
   * The idea this implementation is based on is the fact that a 
   * pointer-to-member is "somewhat a pointer" but not \em really a pointer.
   * Similar to a pointer, a member pointer can be \em unbound, and this
   * is the property we exploit here. But implementation-wise, a member pointer
   * is a type information plus an offset into this type, and thus can't be
   * converted to an integral type. Thus, depending on the result of the
   * \c isValid() function, the conversion operator returns either a
   * bound or unbound member pointer. 
   * 
   * @see bool-checkable-test.cpp
   * @see control::Mutation usage example

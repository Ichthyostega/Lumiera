/** @file thread-local.hpp
 ** Helpers for working with thread local data.
 ** As we don't want to depend on boost.threads, we'll provide some simple
 ** support facilities for dealing with thread local data in RAII fashion.
 ** Draft as of 2/10, to be extended on demand.
 ** 
 ** @todo care for unit test coverage
 ** @todo WIP-WIP. Maybe add facilities similar to boost::specific_ptr

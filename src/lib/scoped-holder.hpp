/** @file scoped-holder.hpp
 ** Some wrappers for coping with ownership problems.
 ** Working with collections of objects, especially in conjunction with
 ** polymorphism, can be challenging when we are bound to care for lifecycle
 ** and ownership for the contained classes. There are several solutions,
 ** including the boost::ptr_container library or lib::ScopedPtrVect, the
 ** use of shared_ptr  or even a garbage collector. Sometimes circumstances
 ** rather call for a very simple or lightweight solution though.
 ** 
 ** ScopedPtrHolder is a simple extension to boost::scoped_ptr, enabling
 ** to use it within STL containers if we stick to a specific protocol.
 ** The idea is to permit copying as long as the scoped_ptr is empty.
 ** This can be used to allow for extension of the STL container on
 ** demand, i.e. to handle the typical situation of a registry which
 ** is initialised lazily, but only released in a controlled fashion.
 ** 
 ** ScopedHolder implements a similar concept for in-place storage of
 ** noncopyable objects within STL containers.
 ** 
 ** While the added copy operations (secured with the "empty" requirement)
 ** are enough to use those holders within fixed sized STL containers,
 ** supporting dynamic growth (like in std::vector#resize() ) additionally
 ** requires a facility to transfer the lifecycle management control between
 ** holder instances. This is the purpose of the \c transfer_control
 ** friend function.
 ** 
 ** @deprecated this is a pre C++11 concept and superseded by rvalue references 
 ** 
 ** @see scoped-holder-test.cpp
 ** @see scoped-holder-transfer.hpp use in std::vector
 ** @see AllocationCluster usage example
 ** @see scoped-ptrvect.hpp simple pointer-holding collection

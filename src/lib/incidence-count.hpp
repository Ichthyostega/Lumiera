/** @file incidence-count.hpp
 ** Record and evaluate concurrent activations.
 ** This observation and instrumentation helper is typically used to capture
 ** density of incidence and effective concurrency of performance critical tasks.
 ** The overhead per measurement call amounts to one SystemClock invocation plus
 ** some heap memory access, assuming that sufficient memory was pre-allocated
 ** prior to the actual observation phase. Moreover, on first invocation per Thread,
 ** a thread local ID is constructed, thereby incrementing an global atomic counter.
 ** Statistics evaluation is comprised of integrating and sorting the captured
 ** event log, followed by a summation pass.
 ** 
 ** # Usage and limitations
 ** This helper is intended for tests and one-time usage. Create an instance,
 ** launch a test, retrieve the observed statistics, destroy the object. Each
 ** separate Threads encountered gets the next consecutive ID. Thus it is *not possible*
 ** to have long-living instances or even multiple instances of IncidenceCount; doing so
 ** would require a much more elaborate ID management, which is beyond requirement's scope. 
 **

 ** @see vault::gear::TestChainLoad::ScheduleCtx

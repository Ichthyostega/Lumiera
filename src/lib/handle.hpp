/** @file handle.hpp
 ** A generic opaque handle to an implementation entity, including lifecycle management.
 ** The intended use is for some public interface to return such a handle to track the
 ** lifecycle or registration of a dedicated service created for this call. The handle
 ** is implemented as refcounting smart-ptr on top of shared_ptr, which especially
 ** means for the client code that the handle has value semantics, can be copied and
 ** stored, while the referred service will stay alive as long as there is still an
 ** handle in use. A handle may be empty ("null handle") or closed; the latter
 ** also decreases the ref count and can be used to close a service explicitly.
 ** 
 ** Possibly a service may use an extension of the handle template carrying dedicated
 ** API functions. In this case, the handle acts like a PImpl; the actual definition
 ** of the implementation class the handle points at is necessary only in the
 ** translation unit implementing such an extended handle.
 **
 ** @see proc::DummyPlayer::Process usage example

/** @file sub-id.hpp
 ** Extensible symbolic ID type. 
 ** @todo (9/09) WIP-WIP-WIP just some vague emerging ideas here...
 ** 
 ** My observation is that, during design, I did run again and again into a specific
 ** situation, which I then needed to circumvent due to a lacking primary solution.
 ** Learning from that experiences, I start building this structured ID template.
 ** - it shall be an \em symbolic identifier, not an artificial ID
 ** - the basic value set should be limited and statically type safe.
 ** - possibility of structured adornments and variations
 ** - optionally concealing these extensions from the interface level
 ** 
 ** The first attempt to build such an entity is based on standard techniques,
 ** disregarding performance and memory footprint considerations.
 ** 
 ** @todo 1/2016 this idea seems very reasonable, and we should just make it
 **       robust and usable, along the lines pointed out by that draft
 **       - remove the `<iostream>` and `format-util` dependency (!)
 **       - provide a hash implementation for real
 **       - extend to arbitrary number of sub-dimensions (variadic)
 **       - implement comparisons as you'd do for any algebraic type
 **       - provide a metaprogramming facility to get an id tuple
 ** 
 ** @see SubID_test
 ** @see MultiFact

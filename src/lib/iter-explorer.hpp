/** @file iter-explorer.hpp
 ** Helper template(s) for establishing various evaluation strategies for hierarchical data structures.
 ** Based on the <b>Lumiera Forward Iterator</b> concept and using the basic IterAdaptor templates,
 ** these components allow to implement typical evaluation strategies, like e.g. depth-first or
 ** breadth-first exploration of a hierarchical structure. Since the access to this structure is
 ** abstracted through the underlying iterator, what we effectively get is a functional datastructure.
 ** The implementation is based on the IterStateWrapper, which is one of the basic helper templates
 ** provided by iter-adapter.hpp.
 ** 
 ** \par Iterators as Monad
 ** The fundamental idea behind the implementation technique used here is the \em Monad pattern
 ** known from functional programming. A Monad is a (abstract) container created by using some specific functions.
 ** This is an rather abstract concept with a wide variety of applications (things like IO state, parsers, combinators,
 ** calculations with exception handling but also simple data structures like lists or trees). The key point with any
 ** monad is the ability to \em bind a function into the monad; this function will work on the \em internals of the
 ** monad and produce a modified new monad instance. In the simple case of a list, "binding" a function
 ** basically means to map the function onto the elements in the list.
 ** 
 ** \par Rationale
 ** The primary benefit of using the monad pattern is to separate the transforming operation completely from
 ** the mechanics of applying that operation and combining the results. More specifically, we rely on an iterator
 ** to represent an abstracted source of data and we expose the combined and transformed results again as such
 ** an abstracted data sequence. The transformation to apply can be selected at runtime (as a functor), and
 ** also the logic how to combine elements can be implemented elsewhere. The monad pattern defines a sane
 ** way of representing this partial evaluation state without requiring a container for intermediary
 ** results. This is especially helpful when
 ** - a flexible and unspecific source data structure needs to be processed
 ** - and this evaluation needs to be done asynchronously and in parallel (no locking, immutable data)
 ** - and a partial evaluation needs to be stored as continuation (not relying on the stack for partial results) 
 ** 
 ** \par preconfigured solutions
 ** This header provides some preconfigured applications of this pattern
 ** - the DefaultCombinator processes the source elements on demand, feeding them through
 **   the given functor and using the resulting iterator to deliver the result elements
 ** - Chained iterator uses similar building blocks just to get the "flattening" of
 **   a sequence of iterators into a single result iterator
 ** - the RecursiveExhaustingEvaluation is another kind of combination strategy,
 **   which recursively evaluates the given function and combines the results
 **   such as to produce classical depth-first and breadth-first search orders.
 ** - the more low-level RecursiveSelfIntegration combinator strategy actually
 **   delegates to the result set iterator implementation to perform the collecting
 **   and re-integrating of intermediary results. This approach is what we actually
 **   use in the proc::engine::Dispatcher
 ** 
 ** Alternatively, just the basic IterExplorer template can be used together with a custom
 ** "combinator strategy" and typically even a specific iterator or sequence to implement very specific
 ** and optimised data structure evaluation patterns. This strategy needs to define some way to hold onto
 ** the original source elements, feed them through the functor on demand and recombine the result sets
 ** into a new sequence to be delivered on demand.
 ** Actually this is what we utilise for the continuous render job generation within the scheduler.
 ** All the other preconfigured variants defined here where created as proof-of-concept, to document
 ** and verify this implementation technique as such.
 ** 
 ** @warning preferably use value semantics for the elements to be processed. Recall, C++ is not
 **      really a functional programming language, and there is no garbage collector. It might be
 **      tempting just to pass pointers through a whole evaluation chain. Indeed, you can do so,
 **      but make sure you understand the precise timing of the evaluation, expansion and
 **      re-integration steps with regards to memory management; an "explorer function"
 **      may pass a reference or pointer to some transient source, which is gone after
 **      incrementing the source iterator.

  /**
   * Adapter for using an Iterator in the way of a Monad
   * This allows to "bind" or "flatMap" a functor, thereby creating
   * a derived version of the iterator, yielding the (flattened) combination
   * of all the results generated by this bound functor. The rationale is
   * to apply some exploration or expansion pattern on the elements of the
   * source sequence (source iterator) -- while completely separating out
   * the \em mechanics how to treat and combine individual elements.
   * 
   * \par implementation approach
   * IterExplorer is a thin wrapper, based on IterStateWrapper; thus the assumption
   * is for the actual elements to be generated by a "state core", which is embedded
   * right into each instance. To provide the monad bind operator \c >>= , we need
   * the help of a strategy template, the so called \em Combinator. This strategy
   * contains the details how to combine the results of various iterators and
   * to join them together into a single new IterExplorer instance. Thus, obviously
   * this Combinator strategy template relies on additional knowledge about the
   * source iterator's implementation. Such is unavoidable, since C++ isn't a
   * functional programming language.
   * 
   * When invoking the bind (flat map) operator, a suitably represented \em functor
   * is embedded into an instance of the Combinator template. Moreover, a copy of
   * the current IterExplorer is embedded alongside. The resulting object becomes
   * the state core of the new IterExplorer object returned as result.
   * So the result \em is an iterator, but -- when "pulled" -- it will in turn
   * pull from the source iterator and feed the provided elements through the
   * \em exploration functor, which this way has been \em bound into the resulting
   * monad. The purpose of the Combinator strategy is to join together various
   * resulting iterators, thereby "flattening" one level of "monad packaging"
   * (hence the name "flat map operator").
   * 
   * @remarks figuring out what happens here just from the code might lead to confusion.
   *          You really need to grasp the monad concept first, which is a design pattern
   *          commonly used in functional programming. For the practical purpose in question
   *          here, you might consider it a "programmable semicolon": it links together a
   *          chain of operations detailed elsewhere, and provided in a dynamic fashion
   *          (as functor at runtime). More specifically, these operations will expand
   *          and explore a dynamic source data set on the fly. Notably this allows
   *          us to handle such an "exploration" in a flexible way, without the need
   *          to allocate heap memory to store intermediary results, but also without
   *          using the stack and recursive programming.
   * @warning be sure to consider the effects of copying iterators on any hidden state
   *          referenced by the source iterator(s). Basically any iterator must behave
   *          sane when copied while in iteration: IterExplorer first evaluates the
   *          head element of the source (the explorer function should build an 
   *          independent, new result sequence based on this first element).
   *          Afterwards, the source is \em advanced and then \em copied 
   *          into the result iterator.
   * @warning IterExplorer and all the provided combination strategies are deliberately
   *          designed to work on sequences <b>of values</b>. These values will indeed
   *          be \em copied for invocation of the exploration function. The rationale
   *          for this choice is data locality and the danger of dangling references
   *          to an implicitly created temporary (since in it is so common practice
   *          in C++ to use \c const& ). Thus, if you need to work on references
   *          to a common data structure, you need to use either pointers or
   *          some reference wrapper explicitly as value type right from start.
   * @param SRC the source sequence or iterator to wrap
   * @param _COM_ "Combinator" strategy template. When binding (\c >>= ) a function,
   *          an instance of that strategy becomes the new SRC for the created new
   *          IterExplorer. This instantiation of the strategy gets as type parameters:
   *          - this IterExplorer's instance type
   *          - the type of the function bound with \c >>=

     * e.g. by returning an empty sequence at some point, otherwise infinite
     * recursion might happen. Another consequence of this repeated re-evaluation

     * the full requirements for building a Monad, we can always work around that kind
     * of restriction by producing the element type of the target sequence by implicit
     * type conversion)
     * 
     * \par strategy requirements
     * To build a concrete combinator a special strategy template is required to define
     * the actual implementation logic how to proceed with the evaluation (i.e. how to
     * find the feed of the "next elements" and how to re-integrate the results of an
     * evaluation step into the already expanded sequence of intermediary results.
     * Moreover, this implementation strategy pattern is used as a data buffer
     * to hold those intermediary results. Together, this allows to create
     * various expansion patterns, e.g. depth-first or breadth-first.
     * - \c Strategy::getFeed() accesses the point from where
     *   to pull the next element to be expanded. This function <i>must not</i>
     *   yield an empty sequence, \em unless the overall exploration is exhausted
     * - \c Strategy::feedBack() re-integrates the results of an expansion step
     *

     * an initial result set. This initial set can be conceived to hold the seed
     * or starting points of evaluation. Elements are consumed by an iterator, at
     * the front. Each element is fed to the "explorer function". This exploration
     * returns an expanded result sequence, which is immediately integrated into the
     * overall result sequence, followed by further exploration of the then-to-be first
     * element of the result sequence. All this exploration is driven on-demand, by
     * consuming the result sequence. Exploration will proceed until exhaustion,
     * in which case the exploration function will yield an empty result set.
     * 
     * This strategy is intended for use with the IterExplorer -- most prominently
     * in use for discovering render prerequisites and creating new render jobs for
     * the engine. The RecursiveSelfIntegration  strategy is a partially reduced
     * and hard-coded variation on the #RecursiveExhaustingEvaluation in depth-first
     * configuration.
     * This setup works in conjunction with a <i>special result sequence</i> type,
     * with the ability to re-integrate results yielded by partial evaluation.
     * But the working pattern is more similar to the #CombinedIteratorEvaluation,
     * where the focal point of further expansion is always at the front end of
     * further items yet to be consumed and expanded; thus the evaluation is
     * bound to proceed depth-first (i.e. it is \em not possible to "integrate"
     * any intermediary result with the \em whole result set, only with the part
     * reachable immediately at the evaluation front)
     * 
     * \par usage considerations
     * There needs to be a specific sequence or iterator type, which is used to
     * hold the result set(s). This custom type together with the Explorer function
     * are performing the actual expansion and re-integration steps. The latter is
     * accessed through the free function \c build(sequence) -- which is expected
     * to return a "builder trait" for manipulating the element set yielded by
     * the custom iterator type returned by the Explorer function.
     * 
     * @param SRC the initial result set sequence; this iterator needs to yield
     *            values of the special ResultIter type, which are then expanded
     *            until exhaustion by repeated calls to the Explorer function
     * @param FUN the Explorer function of type ResultIter -> ResultIter
     * @note the ResultIter type is defined implicitly through the result type
     *            of the Explorer function. Similarly the result value type
     *            is defined through the typedef \c ResultIter::value_type
     * @warning beware of dangling references; make sure you never pass a
     *            reference or pointer through the Explorer function unaltered. 
     *            Because some source iterator might expose a reference to a
     *            transient object just for the purpose of expanding it.
     *            The very reason of building iterator pipelines is to
     *            avoid heap allocation and to produce intermediaries
     *            on demand. So make sure in such a case that there is
     *            at least one real copy operation in the pipeline.

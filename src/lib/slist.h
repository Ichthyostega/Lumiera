/**
 * @file
 * Intrusive cyclic single linked list.
 *
 * List node is a structure, which consists only of a forward pointer. This is
 * much easier and makes code much cleaner, than to have forward pointer as is.
 * In a empty initialised node, this pointer points to the node itself. Note
 * that this pointer can never ever become NULL.
 *
 * This lists are used by using one node as 'root' node where it's pointer is
 * the head pointer to the actual list. Care needs to be taken to ensure not to
 * apply any operations meant to be applied to data nodes to the root node.
 * This way is the preferred way to use this lists.
 *
 * Alternatively one can store only a chain of data nodes and use a SList
 * pointer to point to the first item (which might be NULL in case no data is
 * stored). When using such approach care must be taken since most functions
 * below expect lists to have a root node.
 *
 * Due to nature of single linked list, there's no easy way to implement
 * functions, which need reverse passing through a list. But some of L1-list
 * interface functions need such ability (for example, when we need to find
 * previous element for current element). Because search of previous element
 * requires visiting of exactly N-1 nodes (where N is length of L1-list), we
 * use root node as start point. This gives to us probability of visiting
 * 1 <= C <= N-1 nodes, and, thus, speed up search.
 *
 * This header can be used in 2 different ways:
 * 1) (preferred) just including it provides all functions as static inlined
 *    functions. This is the default
 * 2) #define LLIST_INTERFACE before including this header gives only the declarations
 *    #define LLIST_IMPLEMENTATION before including this header yields in definitions
 *    this can be used to generate a library. This is currently untested and not
 *    recommended.
 * The rationale for using inlined functions is that most functions are very
 * small and likely to be used in performance critical parts. Inlining can give
 * a huge performance and optimisation improvement here. The few functions
 * which are slightly larger are expected to be the less common used ones, so
 * inlining them too shouldn't be a problem either.

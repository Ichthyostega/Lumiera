/** @file depend.hpp
 ** Singleton services and Dependency Injection.
 ** The <b>Singleton Pattern</b> provides a single access point to a class or
 ** service and exploits this ubiquitous access point to limit the number of objects
 ** of this type to a single shared instance. Within Lumiera, we mostly employ a
 ** factory template for this purpose; the intention is to use on-demand initialisation
 ** and a standardised lifecycle. In the default configuration, this \c Depend<TY> factory
 ** maintains a singleton instance of type TY. The possibility to install other factory
 ** functions allows for subclass creation and various other kinds of service management.
 ** 
 ** 
 ** # Why Singletons? Inversion-of-Control and Dependency Injection
 ** 
 ** Singletons are frequently over-used, and often they serve as disguised
 ** global variables to support a procedural programming style. As a remedy, typically
 ** the use of a »Dependency Injection Container« is promoted. And -- again typically --
 ** these DI containers tend to evolve into heavyweight universal tools and substitute
 ** the original problem by metadata hell.
 ** 
 ** Thus, for Lumiera, the choice to use Singletons was deliberate: we understand the
 ** Inversion-of-Control principle, yet we want to stay just below the level of building
 ** a central application manager core. At the usage site, we access a factory for some
 ** service *by name*, where the »name« is actually the type name of an interface or
 ** facade. Singleton is used as an _implementation_ of this factory, when the service
 ** is self-contained and can be brought up lazily.
 ** 
 ** ## Conventions, Lifecycle and Unit Testing
 ** 
 ** Usually we place an instance of the singleton factory (or some other kind of factory)
 ** as a static variable within the interface class describing the service or facade.
 ** As a rule, everything accessible as Singleton is sufficiently self-contained to come
 ** up any time -- even prior to `main()`. But at shutdown, any deregistration must be done
 ** explicitly using a lifecycle hook. Destructors aren't allowed to do _any significant work_
 ** beyond releasing references, and we acknowledge that singletons can be released
 ** in _arbitrary order_.

   * Access point to singletons and other kinds of dependencies.
   * Actually this is a Factory object, which is typically placed into a
   * static field of the Singleton (target) class or some otherwise suitable interface.
   * @param SI the class of the Singleton instance
   * @note uses static fields internally, so all factory configuration is shared per type
   * @remark there is an ongoing discussion regarding the viability of the
   *   Double Checked Locking pattern, which requires either the context of a clearly defined
   *   language memory model (as in Java), or needs to be supplemented by memory barriers.
   *   In our case, this debate boils down to the question: does \c pthread_mutex_lock/unlock
   *   constitute a memory barrier, such as to force any memory writes happening \em within
   *   the singleton ctor to be flushed and visible to other threads when releasing the lock?
   *   To my understanding, the answer is yes. See
   *   [POSIX](http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/000095399/basedefs/xbd_chap04.html#tag_04_10)
   * @remark we could consider to rely on a _Meyers Singleton_, where the compiler automatically
   *   generates the necessary code and guard variable to ensure single-threaded initialisation
   *   of the instance variable. But the downside of this approach is that we'd loose access
   *   to the singleton instance variable, which then resides within the scope of a single
   *   access function. Such would counterfeit the ability to exchange the instance to
   *   inject a mock for unit testing.

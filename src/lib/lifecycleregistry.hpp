/** @file lifecycleregistry.hpp
 ** Helper for registering lifecycle event callbacks, which are
 ** provided as a global service by lumiera::AppState. This service
 ** allows to enrol functions under a given label and then to call
 ** all those registered functions. 
 ** @note this is in fact an event mechanism, and if we start using
 ** more than just this basic functionality, we should switch to
 ** boost::signals. (which has the downside of being an binary
 ** dependency).

/** @file scope-query.hpp
 ** Specific queries to explore contents of a scope within the high-level model.
 ** This is an application of the QueryResolver facility, and used heavily to
 ** provide the various search and exploration functions on the session API.
 ** It is implemented by accessing a SessionService, which resolves the
 ** queries by iteration on the PlacementIndex behind the scenes.

   * Query a scope to discover it's contents or location.
   * This is a special kind of query, wired up such as to enumerate
   * the contents or parents of a scope, filtered by a subtype-check.
   * For the actual resolution of the elements to discover, this query
   * relies on an index like facility (usually Session's PlacementIndex),
   * which is abstracted as a QueryResolver, but actually is expected to
   * cooperate especially with this Query subclass to retrieve the scope
   * to be enumerated and the definition of the actual filter predicate.
   * Currently (11/09), there is a special, hard-wired Query-kind-ID
   * \c Goal::DISCOVERY to distinguish this special kind of a Query.
   * 
   * Contrary to the usual handling of a generic query, a ScopeQuery
   * object holds it's own discovery iterator and thus is completely
   * self contained. The query is issued automatically on construction,
   * thus the embedded iterator immediately points at the first result.
   * Moreover, since any Lumiera Forward Iterator is \c bool checkable,
   * a ScopeQuery not yielding any results will evaluate to \c false
   * immediately after construction, allowing convenient inline checks.
   * The query can be re-issued by the function operator, and the
   * embedded result iterator can of course be copied to a bare
   * iterator instance, e.g. for passing it on (ScopeQuery
   * itself is intended to be used polymorphically and
   * thus defined to be not assignable)

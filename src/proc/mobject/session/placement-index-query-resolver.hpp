/** @file placement-index-query-resolver.hpp
 ** Implementing resolution of "discover contents"-queries based on PlacementIndex.
 ** This wrapper adds a service to resolve queries for exploring the contents or
 ** the parent path of a given scope; the actual implementation relies on the 
 ** basic operations provided by the PlacementIndex; usually this wrapper is
 ** instantiated as one of the SessionServices for use by Proc-Layer internals.
 ** The PlacementIndex to use for the implementation is handed in to the ctor.
 ** 
 ** As any of the QueryResolver services, the actual resolution is completely
 ** decoupled from the querying client code, which retrieves the query results
 ** through an iterator. Parametrisation is transmitted to the resolver using a
 ** special subclass of Goal, a ScopeQuery. Especially, besides a filter to apply
 ** on the results to retrieve, the direction and way to search can be parametrised: 
 ** - ascending to the parents of the start scope
 ** - enumerating the immediate child elements of the scope
 ** - exhaustive depth-first search to get any content of the scope
 ** 
 ** \par how the actual result set is created
 ** On initialisation, a table with preconfigured resolution functions is built,
 ** in order to re-gain the fully typed context when receiving a query. From within
 ** this context, the concrete Query instance can be investigated to define a
 ** constructor function for the actual result set, determining the way how further
 ** results will be searched and extracted. The further exploration is driven by the
 ** client pulling values from the iterator until exhaustion.

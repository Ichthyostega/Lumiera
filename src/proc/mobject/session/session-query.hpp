/** @file session-query.hpp
 ** Supporting queries for session contents.
 ** 
 ** WIP-WIP as of 6/10
 ** 
 ** Idea is to collect here various bits required to issue queries
 ** and retrieve specific session contents, allowing to keep the
 ** main session.hpp more lightweight.

 ** @see Session public API
 ** @see query-resolver.hpp

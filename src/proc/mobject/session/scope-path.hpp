/** @file scope-path.hpp
 ** An Object representing a sequence of nested scopes within the Session.
 ** MObjects are being attached to the model by Placements, and each Placement
 ** is added as belonging \em into another Placement, which defines the Scope
 ** of the addition. There is one (formal) root element, containing the timelines;
 ** from there a nested sequence of scopes leads down to each Placement.
 ** Ascending this path yields all the scopes to search or query in proper order
 ** to be used when resolving some attribute of placement. Placements use visibility
 ** rules comparable to visibility of scoped definitions in common programming languages
 ** or in cascading style sheets, where a local definition can shadow a global one.
 ** In a similar way, properties not defined locally may be resolved by querying
 ** up the sequence of nested scopes.
 ** 
 ** A scope path is represented as sequence of scopes, where each Scope is implemented
 ** by a PlacementRef pointing to the »scope top«, i.e. the placement in the session
 ** constituting this scope. The leaf of this path can be considered the current scope.
 ** ScopePath is intended to be used for remembering a \em current location within the
 ** model, usable for resolving queries and discovering contents.
 ** 
 ** \par operations and behaviour
 ** 
 ** In addition to some search and query functions, a scope path has the ability to 
 ** \em navigate to a given target scope, which must be reachable by ascending and
 ** descending into the branches of the overall tree or DAG (in the general case).
 ** Navigating is a mutating operation which usually happens when the current
 ** "focus" shifts while operating on the model.
 ** 
 ** - ScopePath can be default constructed, yielding an \em invalid path.
 ** - When created with a given target Scope, a connection to the current Session
 **   is created behind the scenes to discover the path starting from this target
 **   Scope up to model root. This is the core "locating" operation. It may fail.
 ** - There is a pre defined \c ScopePath::INVALID token
 ** - ScopePaths are intended to be handled <b>by value</b> (as are Scopes and
 **   PlacementRefs). They are equality comparable and provide several specialised
 **   relation predicates.
 ** - while generally copying is permitted, you may not overwrite an ScopePath
 **   which is attached (referred by a QueryFocus, see below)
 ** - all implementations are focused on clarity, not uttermost performance, as
 **   the assumption is for paths to be relatively short and path operations to
 **   be executed rather in a GUI action triggered context.
 ** - the iteration (Lumiera Forward Iterator) yields the path elements in
 **   \em ascending order, starting with the leaf element
 ** - a path containing just the root element evaluates to \c bool(false) 
 **   (rationale is that any valid, usable path is below just root).
 ** - an empty (nil) path doesn't even contain the root element and 
 **   may throw on many operations.
 ** 
 ** \par relation to ScopeLocator
 ** 
 ** ScopeLocator holds the QueryFocusStack, which contains ScopePath objects.
 ** Each of these stack frames represents the current location for some evaluation
 ** context; it is organised as stack to allow intermediate evaluations. Management
 ** of these stack frames is automated, with the assistance of ScopePath by
 ** incorporating a ref-count. Client code usually accesses this mechanism
 ** through QueryFocus objects as frontend, which is reflected in the
 ** mentioned embedded refcount

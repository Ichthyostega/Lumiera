/** @file label.hpp
 ** A marker or reference point in the Session.
 ** Label MObjects can be [placed](\ref Placement) at various locations and scopes,
 ** e.g. on the timeline, or relative to the media data of a clip. They can be used to give
 ** a visual clue for the user's orientation within the edit, or for navigation on the timeline,
 ** but also as an anchor point to place other elements with relative offset.
 ** 
 ** @todo result of the very first code generation from UML in 2008.
 ** @todo this is expected to become a very important facility eventually, so expec a lot of rework here...

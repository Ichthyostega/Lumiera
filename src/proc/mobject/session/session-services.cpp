/** @file session-services.cpp
 ** Implementation of some top-level internal services of the session.
 ** The Session is _the_ central interface to access the model and thus the
 ** edit being worked on. Behind the scenes, it needs to operate several technically
 ** quite involved services, which we prefer to hide away as implementation details.
 ** Typically, each of these services defines a dedicated interface, and is implemented
 ** by delegating to a set of more specialised facilities.
 ** 
 ** The following services are integrated here
 ** - service to access a Placement by (hash) ID
 ** - service to attach or remove session content, while maintaining all indices
 ** - service to query and explore session contents
 ** - service to inject mock content for unit testing
 ** - service to manage and discover default settings by resolution query
 ** 
 ** @todo WIP implementation of session core from 2010
 ** @todo as of 2016, this effort is considered stalled but basically valid

   * Interface: a workbench-like tool used by the builder 
   * for wiring up a specific building situation, followed by
   * the application/execution of a single building step. Mould is 
   * conceived as the passive part, while usually the ProcPatt plays
   * the role of the active counterpart. By means of the Mould interface,
   * the specifics of a build situation are abstracted away, thus allowing
   * the processing pattern to be defined as working on symbolic locations.
   * Most commonly this is "current", denoting the render node just being built.

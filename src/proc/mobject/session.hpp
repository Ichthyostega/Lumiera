/** @file session.hpp
 ** @ingroup session
 ** Primary Interface to the current Session.
 ** The session interface can be used to discover session contents.
 ** Mostly, these objects within the session are MObject subclasses, but they
 ** are attached into the session by a Placement. Usually, you'd want to use
 ** the discovered objects to invoke operations on them; in most cases,
 ** invoking any mutating operation should be wrapped into a Command.
 ** 
 ** The Interface Session is abstract and only accessible via the
 ** static field Session::current, which actually refers to a SessManager 
 ** singleton instance. The latter acts as smart ptr-to-Impl for accessing the
 ** current session, but at the same time exposes a lifecycle/management API.
 ** 
 ** @note if interested in the interplay of Session, SessManager and the
 **       internal service APIs (SessionServices), you should have a look
 **       at session-service-access-test.cpp, as this test creates a complete
 **       but simplified mock setup of the session and session manager, without
 **       any access and synchronisation and similar concerns, to read top down.
 **
 ** @see session-structure-test.cpp
 ** @see timeline-sequence-handling-test.cpp

  /**
   * The (current) Session holds all the user
   * visible content to be edited and manipulated
   * within the Lumiera Application. From a users
   * perspective, it is a collection of Media Objects
   * (--> MObject) placed (--> Placement) onto virtual
   * Tracks.
   * 
   * Opening a Session has effectively global consequences, 
   * because the Session defines the available Assets, and some 
   * kinds of Assets define default behaviour. Thus, access to the
   * Session is similar to a Singleton, through \c Session::current
   * Besides the SessionManager, several sub-interfaces are exposed
   * as embedded components: DefaultsManger, timelines and sequences.
   * 
   * @note Any client should be aware that the Session can be closed, 
   *       replaced and loaded. The only way to access the Session is
   *       via a "PImpl" smart pointer session::PSess (which indeed is
   *       a reference to the SessManager and is accessible as the static
   *       field Session::current). Clients shouldn't try to get a direct
   *       pointer or reference to the Session object.

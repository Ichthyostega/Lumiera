/** @file config-resolver.hpp
 ** Definition of the concrete frontend for rule based configuration within the session.
 ** 
 ** @remarks This code will act as a hub to pull in, instrument and activate a lot of further code.
 **          All the types mentioned in the #InterfaceTypes typelist will be prepared to be used
 **          in rules based setup and configuration; this definition will drive the generation of
 **          all the necessary bindings and registration entries to make this work. This is in
 **          accordance with the principle of <i>generic programming:</i> Instead of making things
 **          uniform, we use related things in a similar manner.
 ** @note this is placeholder code using a preliminary/mock implementation... don't take this code too literal!
 ** @todo clarify the relation of config query and query-for-defaults   ///////////////TICKET #705
 ** 
 ** @see lumiera::Query
 ** @see mobject::session::DefsManager
 ** @see asset::StructFactory 
 ** @see fake-configrules.hpp currently used dummy-implementation
 ** @see

   * @internal Helper for organising preconfigured default objects.
   * Maintains a collection of objects known or encountered as "default"
   * for a given type. This collection is ordered by "degree of constriction",
   * which is implemented by counting the number of predicates in the query
   * used to define or identify each object.
   * Accessing an object identified by a query causes the query to be resolved
   * (executed in prolog), which may result in some additional properties of
   * the object being bound or specified.
   * @todo as of 3/2008 the real query implementation is missing, and the
   * exact behaviour has to be defined.

/** @file command-mutation.hpp
 ** Core of a Proc-Layer command: functor containing the operation to be executed.
 ** Each command holds two of these functors: one representing the actual operation
 ** and one to undo the effect of this operation. The latter involves the capturing
 ** and storing of a "memento" value behind the scenes. But towards Command, the
 ** Mutation acts as interface to conceal these details, as well as the actual
 ** type and parameters of the functions to be invoked. Thus, Mutation's
 ** public interface just consists of a function call operator.
 ** 
 ** Mutation objects are based on lib::OpaqueHolder, which yields a fixed size storage,
 ** allowing them e.g. to be embedded immediately within the CommandImpl frame.
 **

 ** @see ProcDispatcher

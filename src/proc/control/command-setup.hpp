/** @file command-setup.hpp
 ** Provision for setup of concrete commands for use by the UI.
 ** A *Proc-Layer command* is a functor, which can be parametrised with actual arguments.
 ** It needs to be [defined](command-def.hpp) beforehand, which means to establish an unique
 ** name and to supply three functions, one for the actual command operation, one to capture
 ** state and one to _undo_ the effect of the command invocation. CommandSetup allows to create
 ** series of such definitions with minimal effort. Since any access and mutation from the UI into
 ** the Session data must be performed by invoking such commands, a huge amount of individual command
 ** definitions need to be written eventually.
 ** 
 ** The macro COMMAND_DEFINITION(_NAME_) allows to introduce a new definition with a single line,
 ** followed by a code block, which actually ends up as the body of a lambda function, and receives
 ** the bare CommandDef as single argument with name `cmd`. The `_NAME_` argument of the macro ends up
 ** both stringified as the value of the command-ID, and as an variable holding a new CommandSetup
 ** instance. It is assumed that a header with corresponding _declarations_ (the header \ref cmd.hpp)
 ** is included by all UI elements actually to use, handle and invoke commands towards the
 ** session-command-facade.h
 **

   * Marker and Helper for writing Proc-Layer Command definitions.
   * Together with the Macro #COMMAND_DEFINITION, such definitions
   * may be written statically, in DSL-style:
   * - statically define a variable of type CommandSetup,
   *   with external linkage
   * - the ctor argument is what will be used as command-ID
   * - assign a functor, function or lambda to this variable,
   *   with the signature `void(CommandDef&)`
   * - the argument passed to this functor will be the CommandDef
   *   about to be configured and registered. Thus, the body of the
   *   functor should use the member functions of CommandDef to setup
   *   the command's operation, state capturing and undo functions.
   * - behind the scenes, a lumiera::LifecycleHook is scheduled
   *   to run ON_GLOBAL_INIT. When this hook is activated, all the
   *   lambdas assigned to all CommandSetup instances thus far will
   *   be invoked one by one. Which causes all those commands actually
   *   to be defined and configured for use with the session subsystem.

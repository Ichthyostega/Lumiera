/** @file typed-id.hpp
 ** Frontend for a registration service to associate object identities, symbolic identifiers and types.
 ** For maintaining persistent objects, generally an unique object ID is desirable. Within Lumiera, we employ
 ** 128 hash-IDs \c LUID. But hash-IDs arn't self explanatory for human readers and expressive when used for
 ** testing, configuration and rules. A symbolic ID reads much better for this purpose. This registration
 ** service is used to bridge this gap, allowing for symbolic lookup of objects with known type and for
 ** enumeration of all objects of a specific type.
 ** 
 ** @note as of 4/2010 this is an experimental setup and implemented just enough to work out
 **       the interfaces. Ichthyo expects this registration service to play a crucial role
 **       when it comes to integrating a real resolution engine (prolog). For now, the
 **       only interesting point is how to handle the automatic registration.
 ** 
 ** @see configrules.hpp
 ** @see typed-lookup.cpp corresponding implementation
 ** @see typed-id-test.cpp

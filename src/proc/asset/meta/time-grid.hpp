/** @file time-grid.hpp
 ** Establishing a reference scale for quantised time values.
 ** Contrary to the continuous Time values (Lumiera internal time scale),
 ** quantised time can only take on some discrete values corresponding
 ** to blocks or frames, according to the respective \em timecode format.
 ** The act of quantising continuous time values requires the definition
 ** of a time grid of such allowed time values. At least, the specification
 ** of a time origin and a frame spacing is required, but there might be
 ** way more elaborate specifications, e.g. a grid varying over time.
 ** 
 ** Time grid specifications are integrated into Lumiera's framework
 ** for meta assets, automation, configuration and similar metadata.
 ** 
 ** \par using time grids
 ** TimeGrid is an interface (ABC), but provides some actual factory
 ** functions, which can be used as a convenience shortcut to fabricate
 ** the kind of simple time grid used most often.
 ** 
 ** @see MetaFactory creating concrete asset::Meta instances
 ** @see time::Quantiser

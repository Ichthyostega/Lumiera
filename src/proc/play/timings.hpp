/** @file timings.hpp
 ** How to define a timing specification or constraint.
 ** A timing spec is used to anchor a data stream with relation to a time axis or frame grid.
 ** There are two kinds of timing specs:
 ** - nominal timing specifications relate to the nominal time values
 **   of the frames in a data stream, i.e. the "should be" time values.
 **   These might be values derived from a timecode or just values in
 **   in relation to the timeline axis, but without any connection to
 **   the real wall clock time
 ** - actual timing specifications are always connected or related to
 **   an external time source, typically just wall clock time. For example,
 **   actual timing specs dictate the constraints for real time frame
 **   delivery to an external output connection.
 **

/** @file play-process.hpp
 ** Organisational unit of an ongoing render- or playback process.
 ** A process object doesn't perform any work in itself, rather it's
 ** an entry in the process table maintained within the PlayService.
 ** This table entry is used to keep track of the individual data feeds,
 ** each corresponding to one of the global pipes to be "performed" in order
 ** to generate output data. Usually, these global pipes all belong to a given
 ** Timeline (but other setups are possible as well).
 ** 
 ** Each of these Feed objects comprising a play process is in turn responsible
 ** for getting one or multiple CalculationStream entities configured and operative
 ** within the actual render engine. Each of these calculation streams corresponds
 ** to a running series of calculations for consecutive frames, to be delivered
 ** in a time-bound fashion from the render engine into an OutputSlot, allocated
 ** for rendering this specific feed.
 ** 
 ** A PlayProcess isn't exposed directly to client code -- it's the body object,
 ** while a Play::Controller handle is returned to the client (PImpl pattern).
 ** Using this controller frontend, clients are allowed to control and change
 ** the playback or rendering state and goals, which then causes the PlayProcess
 ** to reconfigure the ongoing or planned calculations.
 ** 
 ** @see lumiera::DummyPlayer
 ** @see gui::PlaybackController usage example

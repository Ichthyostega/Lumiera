/** @file buffhandle.hpp
 ** A front-end to support the buffer management within the render nodes.
 ** When pulling data from predecessor nodes and calculating new data, each render node
 ** needs several input and output buffers. These may be allocated and provided by various
 ** different "buffer providers" (for example the frame cache). Typically, the real buffers
 ** will be passed as parameters to the actual job instance when scheduled, drawing on the
 ** results of prerequisite jobs. Yet the actual job implementation remains agnostic with
 ** respect to the way actual buffers are provided; the invocation just pushes BuffHandle
 ** objects around. The actual render function gets an array of C-pointers to the actual
 ** buffers, and for accessing those buffers, the node needs to keep a table of buffer
 ** pointers, and for releasing the buffers later on, we utilise the buffer handles.
 ** 
 ** These buffer handles are based on a buffer descriptor record, which is opaque as far
 ** as the client is concerned. BufferDescriptor acts as a representation of the type or
 ** kind of buffer. The only way to obtain such a BufferDescriptor is from a concrete
 ** BufferProvider implementation. A back-link to this owning and managing provider is
 ** embedded into the BufferDescriptor, allowing to retrieve an buffer handle, corresponding
 ** to an actual buffer provided and managed behind the scenes. There is no automatic
 ** resource management; clients are responsible to invoke BuffHandle#release when done.

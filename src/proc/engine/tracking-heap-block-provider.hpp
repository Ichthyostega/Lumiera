/** @file tracking-heap-block-provider.hpp
 ** Dummy implementation of the BufferProvider interface to support writing unit tests.
 ** This BufferProvider is especially straight forward and brain dead: it just claims
 ** more and more heap blocks and never releases any memory dynamically. This allows
 ** to investigate additional tracking status flags for each allocated block after
 ** the fact.
 ** 
 ** The allocated buffers are numbered with a simple ascending sequence of integers,
 ** used as LocalKey (see BufferMetadata). Clients can just request a Buffer with the
 ** given number, causing that block to be allocated. There is a "backdoor", allowing
 ** to access any allocated block, even if it is considered "released" by the terms
 ** of the usual lifecycle. Only when the provider object itself gets destroyed,
 ** all allocated blocks will be discarded.
 **

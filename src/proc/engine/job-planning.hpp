/** @file job-planning.hpp
 ** The "mechanics" of discovering and planning frame calculation jobs.
 ** This is a rather abstract chunk of code, to deal especially with the technicalities
 ** of \em organising the discovery of prerequisites and of joining all the discovered operations
 ** into a sequence of planning steps. The net result is to present a <i>sequence of job planing</i>
 ** to the user, while actually encapsulating a depth-first tree exploration, which proceeds on demand.
 ** 
 ** \par participating elements
 ** All of these job planning operations are implemented on top of the JobTicket. This is where to look
 ** for "actual" implementation code. Here, within this header, the following entities cooperate to
 ** create a simple sequence out of this implementation level tasks:
 ** - JobPlanningSequence is the entry point for client code: it allows to generate a sequence of jobs
 ** - JobPlanning is a view on top of all the collected planning information for a single job
 ** - PlanningState is an iterator, successively exposing a sequence of JobPlanning views
 ** - #expandPrerequisites(JobPlanning const&) is the operation to explore further prerequisite Jobs recursively
 ** - PlanningStepGenerator yields the underlying "master beat": a sequence of frame locations to be planned
 ** 
 ** \par how the PlanningState (sequence) is advanced
 ** PlanningState is an iterator to expose a sequence of JobPlanning elements. On the implementation level,
 ** there is always just a single JobPlanning element, which represents the \em current element; this element
 ** lives as "state core" within the PlanningState object. Advancing to the next JobPlanning element (i.e. to
 ** consider the next job or prerequisite job to be planned for scheduling) is performed through the iteration
 ** control API exposed by JobPlanning (the free functions \c checkPoint, \c yield and \c iterNext. Actually,
 ** these functions are invoked through the depth-first tree exploration performed by JobPlaningSequence.
 ** The implementation of these invocations can be found within the IterExplorer strategy
 ** lib::iter_explorer::RecursiveSelfIntegration. The net result is
 ** - the current element is always accessed through \c yield
 ** - advancing to the next element happens \em either
 **   
 **   - by invoking \c iterNext (when processing a sequence of sibling job prerequisites)
 **   - by invoking \c integrate (when starting to explore the next level of children)

   * This iterator represents a pipeline to pull planned jobs from.
   * To dispatch individual frame jobs for rendering, this pipeline is generated

   * 
   * \par Explanation of the structure
   * 
   * The JobPlanningSequence is constructed from several nested layers of functionality
   * - for the client, it is an iterator, exposing a sequence of JobPlanning elements
   * - a JobPlanning element allows to add a frame render job to the scheduler
   * - actually such an element can even be \em converted directly into a Job (descriptor)
   * - the sequence of such JobPlanning elements (that is, the iterator) is called a PlanningState,
   *   since evaluating this iterator effectively drives the process of job planning ahead
   * - this planning process is \em implemented as a recursive evaluation and exploration of
   *   a tree of prerequisites; these prerequisites are defined in the JobTicket datastructure
   * - there is an underlying grid of evaluation starting points, each corresponding to a
   *   single frame. Typically, each frame generates at least two jobs, one for fetching
   *   data, and one for the actual calculations. Depending on the actual render network,
   *   a lot of additional jobs might be necessary
   * - this basic frame grid is generated by the PlanningStepGenerator, which is
   *   effectively backed by the Dispatcher and thus the render node model. 
   * 
   * @remarks JobPlanningSequence is a monad, and the operation to explore the prerequisites
   *          is applied by the \c >>= (monad flat map operation). This approach allows us
   *          to separate the technicalities of exhausting tree exploration from the actual
   *          "business code" to deal with frame job dependencies
